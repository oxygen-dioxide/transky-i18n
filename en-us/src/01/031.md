# 31 Â· Catching a Cold

Work started at nine, but the alarm was set for 8:20 AM.

Since the change in work hours, Su Yuqing hadn't actually waited for the alarm to go off before getting up. Even if she went to bed at midnight, sleeping until eight o'clock would still give her eight hours of sleep, let alone that most of the time, Su Yuqing went to bed around ten o'clock.

But today was an exception, and even when the alarm went off, Su Yuqing didn't seem to have any intention of getting up.

The first alarm was a birdsong, crisp and pleasant. Being woken up by such an alarm would give one a feeling of waking up naturally.

But if the alarm wasn't canceled the first time, two minutes later, the second alarm would go off, and it would continue until the alarm was canceled.

The second alarm was a heavy metal song, so loud it almost blew the roof off, finally waking Su Yuqing up.

Su Yuqing opened her eyes with some difficulty. Although she heard the incredibly annoying alarm, she felt she couldn't muster the strength. Finally, she turned over, and a white, tender arm stretched out from under the covers.

"Click." The alarm was turned off.

The annoying sound disappeared, but Su Yuqing was still sleepy. Even her brain stopped thinking, forgetting that she had to go to work today. Her only wish now was to sleep a little longer, just a little longer...

She was drowsy, as if she were about to close her eyes again.

But perhaps because Su Yuqing had woken up for a moment, her numb lower body regained sensation. The icy feeling went straight to the bone marrow, finally waking Su Yuqing completely. Although her consciousness was still a little blurry, at least six or seven tenths of her sleepiness had dissipated.

"Can't... can't sleep... work..." Su Yuqing mumbled indistinctly, feeling that even turning her brain to think was difficult at this moment.

Su Yuqing got out of bed. She almost fell face-first to the ground, unable to steady herself. Slowly, she moved her legs, feeling her strength return a little before slowly standing up.

The ice water, which usually made Su Yuqing very alert, only made her slightly more awake today. Was it because the weather had warmed up, so the tap water wasn't cold enough anymore?

Su Yuqing felt like she was sleepwalking, and her eyes were half-closed, as if she hadn't closed them for three days.

"My head is so dizzy..." This uncomfortable feeling was different from the one a few days ago. This time, she felt so dizzy that she wanted to go to sleep immediately, while before, it was chest tightness that made it hard to fall asleep.

"I have so many more pimples..." Su Yuqing tried to open her eyes wide, using this method of diverting her attention to keep herself awake. Otherwise, she was worried that she might fall asleep in the bathroom.

At eight o'clock in the morning in spring, the sun was already quite strong. Warm sunlight shone on the ground, and a breeze carrying the fragrance of flowers blew gently, like a pair of warm hands.

Only, this made Su Yuqing even sleepier, because the sunlight was too strong, making her feel even more dizzy...

"Achoo!" Su Yuqing leaned against the wall and sneezed loudly. This huge sneeze almost drained all her strength, forcing her to squat down to avoid falling.

Her mind went blank, as if someone had hit the back of her neck with a wooden stick. Her throat also felt as if it were being choked, and she felt like she couldn't breathe...

Even as crystal-clear saliva dripped from Su Yuqing's mouth, she didn't notice, as if she had lost control of her body.

Finally catching her breath, Su Yuqing slowly stood up and slowly opened her eyes.

Even simply looking ahead, tears couldn't be stopped from flowing from her eyes, and her eyes felt very uncomfortable, both sore and painful.

Su Yuqing suddenly found herself disliking this bright spring light.

How nice it would be if it were cloudy...

When she was still at school, she always felt that her studies were too heavy, making her not want to go to school and wanting to start working quickly. Now, Su Yuqing understood the good things about school. At least when she was sick at school, she could ask her parents to take a leave of absence, and there wouldn't be much of a problem. But working was different.

Once or twice would be fine, but if she took leave too often, it might annoy the boss. The boss didn't hire someone just to be a waste; they naturally needed someone who could bring them profit, or, enough profit.

Although Boss Li and Aunt Zhang were easy to talk to and gave her holidays and delayed her start time, it was precisely because of this that Su Yuqing couldn't take leave all the time, even if she was sick, she had to try to persevere...

The pressure of life forced her. She didn't want to lose this job. This was a job she had worked hard to find. The next time, for someone like her, who was unhealthy, underage, and didn't have an ID card, it was unknown whether she could even find a job.

So, no matter how uncomfortable, she had to grit her teeth and persevere.

Fortunately, after walking for a while, her muscles and bones loosened up a little, making Su Yuqing feel a little better. She still felt a little dizzy and weak, but it was still within a range she could barely bear.

She hadn't covered herself well with a blanket last night, and coupled with the side effects of the medication, Su Yuqing thought she was doing well not to have a high fever.

She touched her forehead and felt that it was still slightly hot. If she had to buy medicine, she would have to spend the little money she had left. In that case, paying for water and electricity next month would be very tight.

"I hope I can get better on my own..." Su Yuqing thought to herself.

"What's wrong, Xiaoqing? Didn't you sleep well last night?" Aunt Zhang looked at Su Yuqing, whose steps were a little unsteady, and frowned, asking.

"Nothing..." Su Yuqing forced herself to look energetic and smiled somewhat strainedly.

"Take care of your body. Let's eat breakfast first. Not many people are here today, so you don't have to start working right away."

"Hmm..."

Breakfast was fragrant fried sauce noodles. Although Su Yuqing came from a wealthy family, she wasn't particularly picky, especially since Boss Li's cooking was very good. Su Yuqing thought all the noodles he made were delicious, but today, she felt that the bowl of fried sauce noodles in front of her made her feel a little nauseous.

The smell that should have been very tempting made Su Yuqing want to avoid it today.

Not only did she feel nauseous looking at the noodles, but Su Yuqing felt a little nauseous looking at the food other people were eating, and also felt some discomfort in her stomach.

But she had to eat breakfast. If she didn't eat breakfast, her stomach would feel even worse.

Su Yuqing stared blankly for a while, then picked up the vinegar bottle and poured some vinegar into a small dish, then drank it down in one gulp.

What's it like to drink vinegar directly? It's like your teeth are going to fall out from the sourness, and it will make you shiver from the sourness.

But the effect was obvious. The feeling of nausea was immediately suppressed. Although she didn't think the noodles were delicious, at least she didn't reject them. Su Yuqing took this opportunity to finish the noodles. Boss Li knew Su Yuqing had a small appetite, so he didn't give her much, just added some vegetables. For Su Yuqing, this was just right.

"Phew..." Su Yuqing let out a soft breath, tidied up the bowls and chopsticks on the table, and then, without being told, started to get busy.

She tried her best to keep her mind running, because her head was very dizzy. If she didn't concentrate, she might pour the noodle soup on someone without realizing it.

Su Yuqing felt that time passed so slowly, every minute and every second was like torture. She really wanted to lie down on the table and take a nap, but although the business today was so-so, the customers didn't come in batches. They came one or two at a time, which meant Su Yuqing had no time to rest.

She couldn't bear to lie down on the table and sleep either. As a part-time worker, the most important thing was to show her value, not to make others think that she was a waste...

She needed this job, she needed this stable life...

"Let me do that." A broad hand caught the bowl of noodles that Su Yuqing was handing over and placed it steadily on the table.

Su Yuqing raised her head weakly and saw Mo Kong sitting at the table in front of her.

"You... came to eat noodles today too..."

"Yeah, what's wrong? Didn't you sleep well last night? You don't seem to be feeling well." Mo Kong added some chili to his noodles and asked with some concern.

Actually, Su Yuqing and Mo Kong weren't very familiar, but Mo Kong's words still made Su Yuqing feel a little warmth in her heart.

He looks so gentle. It must be very comfortable to sleep in his arms...

As soon as this thought arose, Su Yuqing was startled by herself. Her hazy mind suddenly became clearer because of shyness.

"Hmm?" Mo Kong felt a little strange. The "girl" standing in front of him, for some reason, had cheeks as red as apples. "Are you feeling unwell? Why don't you ask the boss for a leave of absence? It's not good to force yourself."

"No, no, nothing!..." Su Yuqing swallowed, blushing, and took two steps back. "I, I'm fine..."

After saying this, Su Yuqing ran back to the kitchen as if she were fleeing.

"Xiaoqing, what's wrong? Why are you running so fast?" Aunt Zhang asked curiously.

"Ah ah... that... um... are there any more noodles to serve?"

"They're still boiling. Don't worry. Take a rest first. You haven't stopped all morning."

"Mm... hmm..."

Somehow, the words "a lovesick girl" popped into Su Yuqing's mind, making her face even redder.

Although she didn't want to admit it, it seemed to be the case...

Children of this age are naturally at the age of puberty.

It's just that Su Yuqing is different from ordinary boys. The object of her affections is also a man...

However, Su Yuqing considers herself a girl in her heart, so it's not strange that the object of her affection is a man.

Yes, and it's spring, so... it's a season where... certain desires are rampant.

Plus the effect of estrogen... It's not strange to have feelings for a male who has chatted with her a few times and makes her feel gentle and safe.
