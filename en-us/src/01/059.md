# 59 · A Righteous Roar

The afternoon sky, previously bright and clear, suddenly darkened. A fierce wind howled, causing the cloth awning over the grocery store entrance to flap wildly. A thick poplar tree bowed deeply, shedding a flurry of leaves.

It looked like a downpour was imminent.

Su Yuqing hadn't brought an umbrella.  She'd either have to dash home in the rain or borrow one from the owner.

"Xiaoqing." The owner's voice came from behind.  A rough hand rested on Su Yuqing's shoulder, gently stroking it. Her hands were small, but far from smooth.  She must have had pretty hands once, worn down by years of hard work…

"Hmm?" Su Yuqing stared out the window, lost in thought.

"Time for dinner. You can clock out after."

"Huh? So early?" Su Yuqing was surprised. Though the clouds had cast a shadow, it was only 4:30 in the afternoon.

"Hehe…" Zhang Auntie patted Su Yuqing's head kindly. "It's my son's birthday.  It's been years since I celebrated it with him…"

"And this year…?"

"This year I've changed my mind. Money can be earned again, but a son is only one, and birthdays only come once a year.  A half-day's less pay is a small price to pay."

"Oh… I see." Su Yuqing felt a surge of happiness. She could leave early, shower, do laundry, and still have plenty of time.  Maybe she could go to the internet cafe for a while before heading home?

"Noodles are here~ Xiaoqing~" Li Boss beamed, placing a bowl of noodles on the table.  Turning to Zhang Auntie, he said, "Honey, I'll go get the cake. You start cleaning up and preparing to close."

"Hurry up, I wonder if it's ready."

"It should be, uhm… I ordered it this morning…" Muttering to himself, Li Boss grabbed his electric scooter keys and dashed out. The smile on his face spoke volumes of his joy.

Indeed, there were things more important than making money.

Perhaps because of the son's birthday, Su Yuqing's dinner was extra generous. Besides a bowl of kidney flower noodles, there was a special sticky rice cake bought just for her.  It was meant for breakfast tomorrow, since the shop might open late.

Of course, it could also be eaten as a midnight snack.

Zhang Auntie closed the noodle shop's glass door, instantly shutting out the howling wind. The shop felt warm and peaceful. Su Yuqing leisurely ate her noodles while reading a newspaper.

It wasn't a local paper, but the *Zhejiang Daily* from Zhejiang Province.  The news was extensive. In this era before widespread electronic information, newspapers were incredibly important.  Many people read them daily.  This one alone had twenty-odd pages, over forty sides, packed with information.

There were news articles, various small ads, and promotional material for events…

"Hangzhou Man Rescues Woman Attempting Suicide by Jumping Into River."

"Experts Claim Garlic Cures All Illnesses."

"Zhejiang Grain Storage Reaches New Record."

"Pay Your Pension Insurance; The State Will Support Your Retirement—New Pension Plan."

"Good Men, Join the Army; Every Chinese Soldier Will Enjoy State Subsidies and Benefits."

"Boys and Girls Are Equal; Zhejiang Province Sees Rise in Girl Births."

"Have One Child—Only Children Enjoy State Benefits; Zhejiang Province Offers Further Subsidies."

"Buy a City Apartment; Convenient Transportation and Comfortable Living; Hangzhou City Center Luxury Apartments, 56 Square Meters from Only 230,000 Yuan."

"Environmental Protection Bureau: Beijing Air Pollution Within Controllable Range."

The sheer volume of news was overwhelming. Su Yuqing only picked out articles that interested her, especially those about gossip and disputes…

Soon, she was nearing the end of the newspaper. Sipping her soup, she glanced at the remaining bits, mostly advertisements.

"Hiring a Nanny, Room and Board Included…"

"Tianhe Excavators, Your Best Choice."

"Learn to Cook, Join New Oriental Culinary Academy."

"Missing Person Notice, Son Ran Away from Home."

Su Yuqing was about to close the paper when something felt amiss.  She glanced at the last page again, her eyes scanning the dense ads until they landed on a small, almost hidden missing person notice.  The text was tiny and brief.

"Missing Son, Age Fifteen, Pretty Face, Height 149cm, Slender Build, Effeminate Voice, Missing from Hangzhou Home for Over a Month.  Reward Offered for Information! Mr. Su: 1333XXXXXXX"

Though concise, it was almost certainly about her.  In her heart, she was certain it was a notice put up by her parents.

A mixture of excitement and fear sent a shiver down her spine. She felt conflicted; she hoped they'd find her, yet also dreaded it…

Perhaps she feared the consequences of returning home, of being confined, deprived of her medication, until she reverted to a more masculine appearance and was forced back to school?

Her father was certainly capable of it…

It would only mean missing a year of school, a small price to pay for her family.

What should she do? Run?

She didn't know. Zhejiang was vast; would her parents really find her?

And this small town was so remote, it would be difficult.  Su Yuqing's anxiety eased.  For now, she was safe.

Aside from the worry, a small sense of happiness bloomed. It proved her parents still cared, though she wondered why they waited a month to post the notice…

Maybe they couldn't find her in Hangzhou?

"Gulp gulp…" Su Yuqing's appetite was unusually good. She finished the last drop of soup, dabbed her mouth with a napkin, and asked, "Auntie Zhang, can I take this newspaper home?"

"Sure, take it." Auntie Zhang replied nonchalantly.

Su Yuqing nodded, pocketing the newspaper. This was to prevent them from noticing the ad, though they'd already seen it without reaction.  But who knew when boredom might lead them to look at the ads again?

Auntie Zhang was cleaning up.  A few customers came in wanting noodles, but were turned away.

It was the first time the noodle shop closed so early. Su Yuqing found it unusual.  The empty shop felt strange, like an empty school on a non-holiday weekday.

"Then, Auntie Zhang, I'll go?"

Su Yuqing had nothing to pack, only her teacup.

"Mm, go ahead, be careful on your way.  Hurry, you should make it home before the rain." Auntie Zhang glanced at the gray sky.

The wind was strong, the sky dark, the clouds heavy.  Yet, the rain held back. Su Yuqing looked up at the sky, but didn't immediately go home.  She wanted to visit the internet cafe.  It had been a while since she'd checked the forums.  What new threads were there?

The wind howled, drowning out other sounds, leaving only its roar in Su Yuqing's ears.

"Kid, you're pretty tough, huh!"

"Damn it, you ruined our fun last time!"

"You're the one who called the security guards, right? Don't think we don't know!"

"Heh, we've got you now, you're not getting away.  We'll make sure you spend ten days or half a month in the hospital!"

From a dark alley, the shouts of thugs echoed. The wind muffled their voices, carrying them only a short distance.

"Bang!" A fist connecting with flesh. The dull thud spoke of a heavy blow.

Su Yuqing heard the commotion as she passed the alley. She paused, intending to leave, but their words stopped her.

"It sounds like…they're beating…that boy from last time?"

She tried to recall the boy's face, but he was unremarkable, and the darkness of that night made it hard to remember his features.

She didn't dare peek, fearing discovery.  The boy would be beaten, or was already being beaten…

Su Yuqing looked around, wanting to help, but there were no shops or security guards nearby…

Should she go to a nearby store and ask for help?

But would anyone help?

She hesitated. Another pained groan came from the alley.  Finally, she peeked and saw the boy who'd helped her get security, lying on the ground, his mouth swollen and bleeding.

Su Yuqing clenched her fists.  She wanted to help, but couldn't.  Just as she considered asking for help, a shout came from the other end of the alley.

"Stop!"
