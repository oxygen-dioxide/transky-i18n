# 14 · Su Yuqing's Diary

Time slipped away slowly.

Su Yuqing suddenly found that rainy weather wasn't so bad.  There were few customers, giving her plenty of time to daydream and rest.

Soon, it was nine o'clock at night.

The rain continued, but it had lessened from a downpour to a light drizzle.

The sky was dark, devoid of moonlight or starlight; the thick clouds blocked them all.

"Xiaoqing, there's an umbrella in the shop. Take it," Zhang Auntie called out to Su Yuqing before leaving.

"No need… the rain isn't that heavy. I can just walk back."

"Take it. We have an umbrella.  Less rain means less chance of catching a cold."

"Um… then thank you…"

Su Yuqing took the umbrella, opened it outside the shop, holding the umbrella in one hand and a cup full of water in the other, disappearing into the dark night.

"See you tomorrow." Zhang Auntie waved.

"Yeah, see you tomorrow." Su Yuqing turned her head, smiled, and finally left.

Returning to her cozy, self-decorated home, she felt her mood relax.

The first thing she did was wash up.  Su Yuqing splashed cold water on her face, looking at herself in the mirror.

Nothing had changed. Of course not. If the medication worked that fast, the price would probably be instant death.

The better the effect, the greater the side effects.  Most medications are like that.

There was a change, though: a few more pimples had erupted on her forehead, threatening to cover her entire forehead.

Pimples shouldn't be squeezed; it could easily leave scars.  All Su Yuqing could do was wash her face carefully to prevent dirt from clogging her pores.

If handled properly, the pimples would disappear soon enough.

Perhaps because she had been sitting all day, the blisters on her feet had scabbed over. Walking didn't hurt much anymore, just a slight itch.

Even when washing her feet, Su Yuqing was meticulous. She placed her feet in a small basin, carefully scrubbing every part, including the spaces between her toes.

She stopped when her feet were slightly red.

The cold water, however, was unbearable, so she slacked off a bit.

"Hmm… I really should buy a kettle… otherwise, I can't boil water…" Su Yuqing muttered, drying her feet and going to her "bedroom."

Su Yuqing didn't write in her diary every day. She only wrote when she felt like it, or if a week had passed without writing.

Before writing, Su Yuqing took out a small notebook.  It was cute, with a peach pattern printed on it.  She'd won it last month in a school art competition and hadn't written a word in it yet. Now, she used it as a memo pad and ledger.

Su Yuqing wrote "kettle," "thermos," and "curtains" in the memo pad, closed it, and opened her diary.

Su Yuqing's pen hovered over the diary, pausing for a long time before she put it aside.

This diary contained memories of the past.

Since she had moved to this small city to live alone, it meant a new beginning. She should let go of the past. Keeping it as a memory was enough.

A new beginning needed a new diary. Fortunately, Su Yuqing had brought enough notebooks. She chose one with a picture of a dim streetlight on the cover, placed it on the table.

The old diary was put back in the drawer.

Su Yuqing wrote the large characters "Diary" on the first page, carefully adding many cute little patterns around the words. The first page was beautifully decorated, with a light, fresh feel.

Satisfied with her work, Su Yuqing nodded, turned to the next page, and pressed it down firmly to prevent it from flipping back while writing.

"March 6th, 2004…" Su Yuqing softly murmured, writing the date.

Her handwriting was delicate, not at all like a boy's.  She wrote lightly, making her script as soft as she was.

"Yesterday, I officially started taking the medicine: two Progynova, six spironolactone…"

"Couldn't sleep last night, felt very uncomfortable in my chest."

"Very sleepy this morning… felt much better after waking up…"

"Life is settling down. I have my own little place and a stable job…"

"The philosophical things that man said this morning… I wonder what his story is?"

"I think this life is pretty good…"

This was Su Yuqing's first diary entry after her new start. There was much to write: the gratitude, the everyday trifles…

She filled three pages before stopping, feeling a sense of satisfaction.

"Future me, are you happy every day?"  She added this final sentence before putting down her pen, gently stretching.

The window was pitch black, only a dim streetlight illuminating the ground floor below.

It was somewhat similar to the picture on her diary cover.

Perhaps adding rain to the picture would make it even more poignant.

Maybe it was her personality, but Su Yuqing was always sensitive to such melancholic things.  She was the type who would sigh at fallen petals.

"Whew… time to sleep…" Su Yuqing stood up from her chair, making a cute grimace at the dark world outside. "Oh, right, I haven't taken my medicine yet…"

After taking her medicine with water, Su Yuqing reviewed her day to make sure she hadn't forgotten anything before getting into bed.

"Click." The light was turned off.

Perhaps because she'd slept a long time during the day, or perhaps due to side effects from the medication, Su Yuqing felt no fatigue. She tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Her chest felt stuffy again, but better than last night. Still, she tossed and turned until the middle of the night before falling asleep.

The wind blew gently outside, shifting the persistent drizzle.

A completely black stray cat blended into the night, leaping from the wall, seemingly intending to sneak into someone's yard for food.

It walked gracefully and slowly, like a lone assassin, calm and composed.

The black cat, in the rain, reached a window in the yard, silently leaping inside.

A short while later, the black cat assassin emerged, carrying a fish head discarded in a trash can, swiftly leaping over the wall and disappearing into the night, perhaps to enjoy its delicious late-night snack.

…

It was the same quiet, eerie park, the only sound still the swing's creak.

Su Yuqing walked through the park, following her memory to the swing.

But the swing was empty, swaying in the wind.

"Creak—creak—"

The eerie sound frightened Su Yuqing, even though she knew it was a dream.

Or perhaps in dreams, humans have difficulty controlling their emotions.

Dreams often reveal the truest self.

Su Yuqing looked around, hoping to find the strange little boy.

"Sister, are you looking for me?" A voice suddenly came from behind Su Yuqing. She was startled, taking a few steps back, nervously looking at the little boy. What he was doing was even more chilling.

He was holding a pile of thumb-sized pebbles, picking one up and putting it in his mouth. "Crunch, crunch," it sounded like he was crushing bones.

"You… you… what are you eating…"

"Something delicious.  Want some, sister?" The little boy held up what looked like the prettiest stone, offering it to Su Yuqing.

"I… I don't…" Su Yuqing shook her head vigorously. "That's a stone…"

"Yeah, it's a stone." The little boy's answer was normal. Su Yuqing had expected him to say it was food that looked like a stone.

"You know that and you still eat it?  Eating stones will make you feel bad, won't it?"

The little boy frowned and nodded slightly. "Yeah… Sister, eating stones really hurts… But it's important to me. If I don't eat stones, I might not survive… But if I eat them, it hurts… and it hurts more each time…"

Like slow suicide.

"If it hurts so much, why do you eat them?"

The little boy shook his head and put another stone in his mouth. "Sister, you wouldn't understand. I have to eat stones.  Only by eating stones do I feel at ease. Only by eating stones do I feel closer to my dream…"

Su Yuqing's eyes widened. She couldn't understand what the little boy was saying.

"Sister, you'll understand later." The little boy gave Su Yuqing a gentle smile, walked to the swing, sat down, and swayed while eating stones.  "Sister, are you still looking for something? Did you find it?"

"Looking for something… looking for what…" Su Yuqing's head suddenly ached. "I… I can't remember… what I'm looking for…"

She crouched on the ground, holding her head in pain.

The streetlights flickered, "Zzzla zzzla," becoming intermittent.

"Um, sister, it seems we have to part again. See you next time…"

Everything disappeared. Su Yuqing's dream plunged into darkness again.
