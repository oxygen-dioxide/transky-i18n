# 30 · Cat and Mouse

I have to say, Cookie was the strangest cat Su Yuqing had ever seen. Its movements were so human-like, it could almost read minds, and its twin pupils always held a glimmer of human-like intelligence.

“Um… for me?” Su Yuqing pointed at herself, asking.

Cookie nodded, giving her an affirmative answer.

Su Yuqing was speechless, she couldn't help but chuckle, and she felt a touch of warmth, because this cat gave her a feeling of family, of friendship.

Cookie was caring for her, it was so heartwarming…

However, Su Yuqing didn't need a mouse, even if she accepted it, she wouldn't know what to do with it. She wouldn't keep a mouse as a pet, nor would she cook it. She could only smile and refuse Cookie's kindness.

“That… I don't need it. You keep it,” Su Yuqing smiled and patted Cookie's head, saying.

“Meow?” Cookie tilted its head, not understanding Su Yuqing's meaning. Or rather, it knew Su Yuqing was rejecting it, but it didn't understand why.

Because, it was food! Animals lived for food, and such a tender young mouse, perhaps no cat could refuse…

Only, Su Yuqing wasn't a cat, she was a human…

Cookie understood Su Yuqing's meaning, though still puzzled, it finally retracted its paw, picked up the mouse again and went to the corner of the desk, probably planning to finish its dinner right then and there.

The young mouse seemed to understand that it was about to be bitten to death by Cookie, struggling with all its might, constantly emitting "squeak squeak squeak" sounds.

“Stop… Cookie… stop…” Seeing the mouse about to be killed, Su Yuqing didn't want to see such a bloody scene in her house. She was the kind of person who would have nightmares for days after seeing a chicken being slaughtered. If she saw a mouse being bitten to death, gutted, and eaten in her room…

She would probably be unable to sleep soundly for a week.

More importantly, Su Yuqing was a neat freak. She didn't want blood and viscera to stain her desk, it would be a hassle to clean up.

Cookie put down the mouse again, holding it down with one paw, looking at Su Yuqing questioningly, thinking she had changed her mind and was going to accept her gift, so it was about to push the mouse towards her again.

“No…” Su Yuqing quickly waved her hand, not knowing how to express her meaning, “Th-that! Cookie! If you want to eat it, can you eat it outside?”

The confusion in Cookie's eyes deepened.

“The desk will get dirty… can you take it outside to eat…?” Su Yuqing tried her best to gesture, hoping Cookie would understand her.

Finally, Cookie understood half of Su Yuqing's meaning, and curiously carried the mouse to the windowsill outside, continuing to tilt its head and look at her.

“Um… yes, eat it outside…” Su Yuqing nodded vigorously, and even gave Cookie a thumbs-up in praise.

Cookie flicked its ears lightly, turned around and was about to jump down from the windowsill, but was stopped again by Su Yuqing.

“That! Wait…”

“Meow?”

“That… why don't you keep this mouse…” As soon as she said it, Su Yuqing felt a little stupid. Even if Cookie understood, how could it easily let go of its meal? Besides, cats and mice were natural enemies. But since she had said it, she might as well continue, “This mouse's fur is as smooth as silk, it's rare… um… I mean… if you're hungry, you can come to me for some dried fish… ah… no… that… um…”

Su Yuqing was rambling, not knowing what to say.

Cookie didn't seem to notice Su Yuqing's words, probably because it didn't understand. It gave Su Yuqing one last look, then, carrying the mouse, jumped from the windowsill.

“Be careful…” Su Yuqing couldn't help but say, and then she thought it was funny. Why was she talking so much to a cat? It couldn't understand her anyway…

Maybe she was just too lonely.

Su Yuqing looked out the window; Cookie was gone. Its black fur allowed it to easily blend into the darkness, and with its agile movements, it was a natural night walker…

“I still have to wipe the table…” Su Yuqing sighed helplessly, putting away the things on the table temporarily, and then used a rag with some shower gel to carefully wipe it, especially the place where the mouse had been lying, she wiped it back and forth dozens of times.

It was already clean, but only this would make the fastidious Su Yuqing feel comfortable.

Without wiping it several times, she always felt that the dirt from the mouse was still on the table…

After a busy period, Su Yuqing felt a little sleepy. It was already late, and the moon was hanging high. Although Su Yuqing's working hours had been postponed, she still couldn't sleep too late, otherwise, she wouldn't be able to get up the next day…

The light was turned off.

The bright moonlight gently shone into Su Yuqing's room, like a gentle and shy girl, secretly watching her sweetheart.

Su Yuqing once again dreamed of that strange park. She stood at the entrance of the park, sighed softly, and finally chose to go in.

There was no way, if she didn't find that little boy, she probably wouldn't be able to get out of this dream world. What a strange dream…

Today, there was no sound of the swing in the park, it was eerily quiet.

And Su Yuqing found that the trees in the park were different from the last few times she had been here.

The last few times she came, these trees were basically covered with deep green leaves, but they looked lifeless.

This time, however, these trees had green leaves on one side and withered yellow leaves on the other, and when Su Yuqing walked past, or when the wind blew, the withered yellow leaves would rustle down.

It was as if spring and autumn were coexisting in this park…

“It’s just a dream, even if there are illogical things, it's not worth being surprised…” Su Yuqing said to herself, walking straight towards the little boy's place. She wanted to leave this strange park early and get a good night's sleep—if she dreamed all night, she would feel listless the next day, and even her whole body would ache.

The swing area was soon reached, but the little boy was not there.

Su Yuqing looked around, thinking, “He’ll probably suddenly appear from somewhere again?”

But after waiting for a while, the little boy was still nowhere to be seen.

“Where did he go…” Su Yuqing mumbled, turning around, but still couldn't find him.

Perhaps, the little boy wouldn't appear today.

Su Yuqing thought as she walked to the swing, gently touched the rusty iron chain of the swing, and slowly sat down.

It was a dream, but a very real dream, because the cold touch of the swing was actually conveyed to Su Yuqing.

Su Yuqing didn't know when she last swung, she only remembered it was a long time ago, so long ago that she couldn't remember, she had even forgotten what it felt like to swing.

She thought, and then gently swung the swing, the wind around her seemed to rise and fall with her up and down movements…

Then, as if some switch had been triggered, the streetlights around her flickered again, and the whole park shattered and disappeared like bubbles.

Su Yuqing…

This time, she didn't enter the dark world, but woke up directly.

As soon as she woke up, Su Yuqing felt a sharp pain in her stomach, as if someone was drilling her abdomen with a drill. The feeling made her want to take everything out of her stomach to relieve the pain.

“Ugh…” Su Yuqing frowned tightly, without opening her eyes. She wanted to enter the dream world again, so she could relieve the pain.

But… the pain did not lessen with the passage of time, but instead became more and more unbearable for Su Yuqing.

She had no choice but to lift the quilt, resisting the chilly night, and quickly walked into the bathroom.

Um… Su Yuqing… she… had diarrhea.

She sat on the toilet for a whole hour, her legs were numb, it felt as if her legs were no longer her own.

And when she stood up, she felt dizzy, even after splashing cold water on her face, she still felt very dizzy, as if the whole world was constantly shaking. Su Yuqing hadn't drunk alcohol, but she thought that the feeling of being drunk was probably like this.

Su Yuqing almost used all her strength to walk out of the bathroom, and then her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the ground.

She didn't even have the strength to move a finger.

And at this moment, she felt very sleepy, so sleepy that she was about to fall asleep on the cold ground.

“嘤…” Su Yuqing unconsciously let out a soft moan, but she gritted her teeth and got up from the ground.

If she fell asleep on the ground, she would definitely catch a cold. She couldn't get sick now, and even if she got sick, she would probably have to go to work while sick…

Su Yuqing squinted her eyes, staggering forward on the ground, she didn't even know whether she was asleep or awake. This half-asleep, half-awake feeling made her feel a little dazed. Finally, she managed to crawl onto the bed.

“So cold…” Su Yuqing unconsciously muttered.

Su Yuqing, once on the bed, didn't move. Without the quilt, she would naturally feel cold.

Although she felt cold, Su Yuqing didn't have the strength, or the consciousness, to pull up the quilt. In the end, she instinctively burrowed half of her body into the quilt, but half of her body was still exposed to the air.

The spring night, although not very cold, was still quite cool. Perhaps, Su Yuqing would really catch a cold this time.
