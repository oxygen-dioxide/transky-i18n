# 16 · Signboard Girl

Business was slow at nine in the morning.  The sun was out, but it was mostly overcast.

Today's work was different from previous days. Su Yuqing had a new task – product promotion.

To put it simply, she was the signboard girl.

A small manufacturer of high-quality soup stock found this small noodle shop, which had a decent reputation and business in the neighborhood, hoping to promote their products.

Promoting products naturally required using the space in front of the shop, and it wasn't free. The manufacturer would pay the owner a hundred yuan for renting the space and gave the owner a stack of flyers to distribute to every customer who came to eat noodles.

It originally had nothing to do with Su Yuqing, but the moment the man, who looked more like a factory leader than a salesman, saw Su Yuqing, he immediately set his sights on her.

"Can I ask this young lady for a favor? I was planning to find a young lady to help with the promotion.  People are more willing to listen to a pretty girl than a middle-aged uncle like me!" the middle-aged man laughed heartily. "This is perfect; I don't have to look elsewhere…"

"Uh?" Su Yuqing's face flushed, and she stammered, "B-but… that… I… I'm a… a…"

Su Yuqing didn't want to reveal her identity, but Aunt Zhang and Boss Li, who knew her secret, were standing beside her. It was better for her to say it herself than to let them do it, to avoid further embarrassment.

"Oh?" The middle-aged man sized Su Yuqing up and down, stroked his chin, and smiled. "Looking closely, you can still see a bit of a boyish shadow.  You're really pretty…  Ha, but it's okay, a handsome boy can attract a lot of people too."

"That… but… I… I can't… p-promote…"

"It's not good for a boy to be so shy. This is good practice for you. How about this, I'll give you two hundred yuan, and you just stand there and help me hand out flyers. I'll do the talking.  Is that okay?"

Su Yuqing wasn't fond of attracting attention, not only because of shyness, but also because she didn't like being the focus of too many eyes.  Those complicated gazes made her feel uneasy.

But there was no way around it.  Money talks.

Su Yuqing was short of cash. She had a lot of household goods to buy, but had no money. It worried her all last night.

Today, she encountered… such a good thing… well… it should be considered a good thing.

Just standing there handing out flyers could earn her two hundred yuan a day.  Su Yuqing only earned three hundred yuan a month working at the noodle shop!  Although the noodle shop provided three meals a day, it still made Su Yuqing very tempted.

She hesitantly looked at Aunt Zhang and Boss Li, unsure how to answer.

After all, she was still a helper at the noodle shop, and doing odd jobs for someone else during work hours… wasn't a good idea.

The middle-aged man saw Su Yuqing's hesitation and smiled at Boss Li. "It's fine, it's fine. How about this, Boss Li, I'll give you another hundred yuan, to borrow your little helper for a day. Is that okay?"

"How can I…?"

"Of course, businessmen should focus on fair exchange." The middle-aged man generously handed two hundred yuan to Boss Li. Boss Li politely refused at first, but ultimately accepted it with a smile.

Two hundred yuan was equivalent to a day's income on a good day for the noodle shop.

After deducting rent and other expenses, each bowl of noodles only earned one or two yuan.  They would need at least a hundred customers to earn two hundred yuan a day.

Su Yuqing was also happy because she no longer had any worries.

"Mm!" So, Su Yuqing nodded and accepted the job.

In a daze, Su Yuqing seemed to see the two hundred yuan beckoning her.

It wasn't that Su Yuqing was overly money-grubbing, but without money, she couldn't do anything.  Such a job that didn't require selling her body or soul to earn money easily, she had to seize it.

Before that, Su Yuqing still needed to overcome her shyness around strangers.

So, Su Yuqing stood next to a large signboard taller than her.  The board displayed mouthwatering pictures of the rich soup and a detailed introduction.

Su Yuqing's job was simple: hand a flyer to every customer leaving the shop and every passerby.

Then Su Yuqing watched passersby walk by and stood there in a daze.

"Young man, get to work." The middle-aged man reminded her.

"Ah! Oh… um…" Su Yuqing nodded nervously, summoning her courage to hand a flyer to a customer leaving the noodle shop.

"Hello, please take a look at our new product, this soup seasoning. Just add a little, and it will make the soup incredibly delicious…"

Don't get me wrong, Su Yuqing didn't say that. The middle-aged man beside her said it.

The customer looked at Su Yuqing's cute face and gave the "girl" some face, listening to the middle-aged man's chatter…

But in the end, they left without buying anything.

Su Yuqing handed out flyers to passersby and customers leaving the noodle shop, her head down or turned away each time.  Many people were interested in this shy "girl," and more people stayed to listen to the middle-aged man's sales pitch.

"Ugh… really… I still can't act naturally…" Su Yuqing slumped her head, looking a little discouraged. Facing those strangers and their curious stares, Su Yuqing didn't dare to look up. The courage she had initially mustered had vanished.

Fortunately, it was only handing out flyers, which wasn't a big deal.  The middle-aged man was there to explain, after all. Su Yuqing's role was probably just a lucky charm who could hand out flyers…

Being the center of attention made Su Yuqing very nervous.  She kept pulling down her hat, worried that her flat top would be exposed, or adjusting her clothes, afraid that something looked messy.

Every time she saw someone's curious gaze, Su Yuqing looked down at her toes.

She always thought that the reason people were curious was because a "girl" was wearing boy's clothes…

A girl wearing boy's clothes might only attract curiosity. If they knew she was a boy, they might be even more curious, but the focus would shift from her clothes to her face…

"It's not good to be so shy in society." The middle-aged man jokingly said to Su Yuqing amidst the crowd. It was more like caring for a junior than criticism…

So, Su Yuqing spotted a customer leaving the noodle shop and approached again.

That's right, this wouldn't do…

So, Su Yuqing mustered her courage, handed the flyer to the person, and spoke for the first time while handing out a flyer: "Th-th-that! Pl-please… look!"

Su Yuqing looked up, forcing herself to look the other person in the eye.

It didn't seem that difficult.

Once you take the first step, things often seem easy.

However, the customer's next action threw Su Yuqing back into her shell.

This unkempt young man was the one who ate noodles at the noodle shop yesterday and said he was a writer. Su Yuqing remembered him, so she was a little bolder.

The unkempt man had gentle and calm eyes, like still water. He glanced at Su Yuqing and took the flyer.

Then, his rough fingers lightly touched Su Yuqing's fingertips.

"!" Su Yuqing's face flushed even redder.  She quickly retracted her hand as if she'd been electrocuted.  The words she had been able to smoothly say before became stammering, "Th-th-the high… no… soup high… no… that… high…"

Su Yuqing couldn't utter a complete sentence and felt like she was about to cry.

The unkempt young man calmly looked at her, seemingly very patient.

Su Yuqing wished he would lose interest and leave!

She didn't know whether to continue or stop, and Su Yuqing was caught in a dilemma.

"Um… soup seasoning? Can it directly turn water into soup stock?" The unkempt young man finally stopped waiting for Su Yuqing to speak and simply read the flyer.

"Phew…" Su Yuqing secretly breathed a sigh of relief, blushed, and stepped back to the signboard.

The unkempt man looked up at Su Yuqing, said nothing, and went to the middle-aged man to buy a large box of the seasoning.

Even the middle-aged man found it strange. This was the most decisive customer all day.

After buying the seasoning, the unkempt young man smiled kindly at Su Yuqing, as if he had done something good, and left.

Su Yuqing was puzzled, not understanding the meaning of his smile.

Did he think Su Yuqing would get a commission for each sale, so he bought a box without hesitation?

Uh… no…

"Did he… like me…?" Su Yuqing felt her face could cook an egg.  She shyly pressed her legs together and rubbed them gently, a strange feeling running through her body.

"That… I want to go to the restroom…" Su Yuqing raised her hand and whispered.

"Ah, go ahead." The middle-aged man replied without looking back.

Su Yuqing held her face, shyly walked towards the nearby public restroom. She didn't understand why her body felt slightly warm. That feeling… was so subtle.
