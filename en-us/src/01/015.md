# 15 · Spironolactone Side Effects

Su Yuqing woke up needing to urinate.

The dark dreamscape, pressured by her physical needs, could no longer hold her captive.

Su Yuqing opened her eyes, gazing at the dark ceiling.  The only light source outside was a dim streetlamp.

A light rain continued to fall, showing no signs of stopping.

This is when having a bathroom in your own room comes in handy.

On such a cold night, having to get dressed and run outside to use the toilet would be too much trouble.  By the time you get back to bed, you're practically wide awake, and by the time you fall asleep again, it's almost dawn.

Su Yuqing reached out and flipped the switch on her bedside table. The light came on, strikingly bright in the dark night.

In the dead of night, alone in her room, Su Yuqing always felt like leaving her bed would expose her to monsters lurking in the shadows. Only with the lights on did she feel safe.

Because light dispels darkness.

The hour hand of the clock on her table pointed to three. It was a little after 3 AM.  She had to wake up at 5:20, so she still had about two hours of sleep.

Su Yuqing yawned widely. For someone so sleepy, even ten minutes of sleep would be irresistible.

"Click."

The light went off.

Su Yuqing hugged her warm blanket, adjusting to a comfortable sleeping position, and once again sank into the boundless darkness. It wasn't a dreamless sleep; it was just a world of pure blackness.

Then… Su Yuqing was woken up again by the need to urinate.

Over the next two hours, Su Yuqing woke up to use the bathroom almost every half hour.  The frequent awakenings quickly dissipated her sleepiness, and finally, she just lay in bed, eyes open, waiting for the alarm to go off.

The chirping of birds sounded. Su Yuqing gently slapped the alarm clock to silence it. Already fully awake from her numerous bathroom trips, Su Yuqing sighed and got out of bed.

Another night of poor sleep…

Su Yuqing carefully brushed her teeth in the mirror, only rinsing and spitting after she felt her teeth were thoroughly clean.

The pimples on her forehead hadn't increased in number, but a few had visibly grown larger, causing Su Yuqing considerable distress.  There was nothing she could do except wash her face more carefully.

She had just finished washing up when she felt the urge to urinate again.

She sighed helplessly as she squatted over the small toilet, aiming for the dark, little hole, and relieved herself of more clear, slightly yellowish liquid.

It was strange how much she could still urinate after going so many times already.

After using the toilet, Su Yuqing tidied herself up, put on her baseball cap, and was about to leave when she suddenly remembered something.

"Wait… isn't work at nine o'clock today?"

What could be better than being woken by an alarm clock, only to discover you can sleep in?

The time was 5:40 AM.  Su Yuqing still had plenty of time to sleep, but thinking of her unusual bodily condition, she instantly lost the desire to go back to bed.

The thought of being woken up again by the need to urinate was too agonizing…

"What's going on… I didn't drink that much water last night…" Su Yuqing felt a headache coming on.  "Could it be… the medication?  Hmm… let's check the instructions…"

Su Yuqing pulled out an unopened box of spironolactone from her drawer, took out the instructions, and laid them on the table.

Spironolactone is a diuretic with anti-androgenic properties.  While a low-potency diuretic, if taken in excessive amounts, it can have a significant effect, particularly at night.

The effect varies depending on individual constitution.  Some people might only need to go to the bathroom once at night, while others may need to go constantly.

In such cases, the dosage should be adjusted downwards, gradually increasing it again once the body develops some immunity to the drug.

Otherwise, Su Yuqing's situation would occur.

However, Su Yuqing didn't know how to solve the problem, so she could only continue taking the medication.  Generally, the body would develop antibodies, and then she wouldn't need to urinate so frequently. Of course… this put a considerable strain on her kidneys.

Su Yuqing put the instructions back in the drawer with a headache. She had considered reducing the dosage, but considering she was still developing, if she didn't control it, she might develop in a direction she didn't want. So she gritted her teeth and endured it.

These were just insignificant costs on her journey to her dreams.

The rain had stopped at some point.

The clouds covering the sky gradually dispersed, and the long-awaited sunlight filtered through the thin clouds, bathing the earth in its warmth. Although it was just the rising sun, it felt so warm to Su Yuqing.

Su Yuqing opened the window and took a deep breath. The cool wind gently slipped in from the window, circled around Su Yuqing, and then quietly slipped out again.

After the spring rain, the weather had become somewhat warmer. Perhaps a few more rains, and the weather would become completely warm.

It's starting to feel like spring now.

Su Yuqing took a deep breath. The air was fresh, with the scent of tender grass and a faint, elusive floral fragrance.

There wasn't much entertainment in such a small room. Su Yuqing hadn't brought her phone, otherwise, she could at least play Snake and Tetris.

Of course, there were ways to entertain herself: she could fold paper airplanes or origami cranes; doodle in a notebook; or read novels.

Su Yuqing had been reading novels since the first year of junior high and had always been fascinated by them, though not as fanatically as back then.  Even when she decided to run away from home and live alone, she packed a few novels in her luggage. She truly loved novels.

She hadn't brought many novels; she only selected a few she never tired of reading. Su Yuqing pulled out a few novels from her drawer.  She didn't feel like reading a whole story, so she chose Lu Xun's collection of essays, randomly opened a page, and leisurely began to read.

Lu Xun's words were always incisive, making the reader feel incredibly refreshed.  He was also one of the most skilled satirists in modern Chinese history, always subtly criticizing people or groups without using a single foul word.

Although Su Yuqing didn't understand or only partially understood much of the content, the atmosphere and the level of writing were what she aspired to and admired.

No reason… just because… it seemed impressive.

A child's thoughts are sometimes that simple.

Su Yuqing's eyes fell on a line in the text.

【Embark on life's journey. The road ahead is long and dark, but do not fear. Only those who are fearless will find the path.】

She noticed this sentence because a small wavy line was underlined below it—a note she had made when she first read it.

At the time, this sentence had deeply moved Su Yuqing.  Perhaps it was this sentence that had driven her down this path.  It might not have given her much courage, but at least it opened a small crack in the tightly closed door.

A wry smile appeared on Su Yuqing's face as she thought back on those unpleasant memories…

She thought of her parents, and of that day, and what happened.

She hadn't expected things to happen so quickly, so intensely. Sometimes, when Su Yuqing closed her eyes and opened them again, she still had the illusion that she was still at school, attending classes.

Su Yuqing didn't know if what she was doing was right or wrong. She only knew she wanted to do it.  Perhaps it was stubbornness. This usually obedient girl was strangely stubborn in this matter.

Or perhaps Su Yuqing was just a stubborn person.  She rarely changed her mind once she made a decision. Even if she wavered, she would regain her resolve and stumble forward.

The wind blew gently, stirring up wisps of faint melancholy.

Su Yuqing felt she had become more sentimental than before. Even simply sitting alone could evoke so many random thoughts.

When she came back to her senses, it was already 8:50 AM.

Time always flew by so quickly when she was lost in thought.

"Uh oh!" Su Yuqing hurriedly grabbed her keys and rushed out of the room, slamming the door shut.

Su Yuqing ran to the noodle shop, glanced at the large clock hanging above the shop, and breathed a sigh of relief, confirming that she wasn't late.

The noodle shop wasn't far from Su Yuqing's home; it only took three or five minutes to run there.

But this strenuous exercise was quite exhausting for Su Yuqing.  Even though she wasn't running fast and the distance wasn't long, and she even stopped to rest a few times, when she arrived at her destination, she felt short of breath.

"Huff… huff… ha… huff…" Su Yuqing leaned her hands on her knees, panting like a bellows.

"Xiaoqing, what's wrong?  Were you running hard?" Aunt Zhang asked.

"Huff… I… was afraid… of being late… huff… so I… ran… ran over… huff… so tired…" Su Yuqing found a seat and sat down, her legs unsteady, taking ten minutes to recover.

Su Yuqing licked her lips, feeling her throat dry as dust.  She had already been dehydrated from constantly going to the bathroom, and now she was severely dehydrated.  She had rushed out in a hurry without even bringing her teacup, so she took a disposable cup and poured herself some hot water, drinking it directly, disregarding the heat.

"Ouch!  It's so hot!"

"Drink slowly, there's no hurry," Aunt Zhang said softly.

"Mmm…" Su Yuqing blushed and nodded, staring at the cup for three minutes, making sure it had cooled down enough before finishing it in one gulp.
