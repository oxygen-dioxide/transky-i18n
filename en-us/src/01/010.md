# 10 Â· First Day of Work (Part 2)

"Xiaoqing, you're here," the proprietress, who was picking vegetables, looked up at Su Yuqing and asked with a smile.

"Um... Proprietress..."

"Just call me Aunt Zhang from now on."

"Then... the boss?"

"Call him Uncle Li."  Li, the boss, who was hunched over calculating the cost of the morning's vegetables, also looked up and smiled warmly at Su Yuqing.

It was clear that both of them were gentle and kind people.

Their smiles warmed Su Yuqing considerably.  The stiffness in her body, caused by her worry about doing a bad job on her first day, eased.

"Xiaoqing, have breakfast first."

"Huh? Shouldn't we start working?"

"We'll be busy soon. You won't have the energy to work if you don't eat."

"Um... okay..."

"What kind of noodles do you want, Xiaoqing? Uncle will cook them for you."  Li tapped the pot with an iron spoon and laughed heartily.

"Um... anything is fine..."

"How about a bowl of mixed noodles with a fried egg?"

"Okay..."

The noodles were ready quickly.  Li specially mixed the noodles and brought them to the table where Su Yuqing was sitting.

The noodles were thick, round noodles.  The reddish-brown soy sauce coated each strand evenly.  A fresh fried egg sat atop the noodles, the yolk still slightly runny.  A sprinkle of chopped green onions added to the aroma.

"Thank you..." Su Yuqing said gratefully, feeling that the boss and the proprietress were like her foster parents.

"Eat more.  If it's not enough, I'll cook you some more.  Young man, eat up. You're so frail, you won't find a wife like this." Li joked.

In fact, Su Yuqing didn't have any intention of finding a wife... In her heart, she considered herself a girl.

"Really... thank you very much. You gave me a job and food... it's better than my parents..."

Aunt Zhang, who had been picking vegetables, put the processed vegetables into a basket, a thoughtful expression in her eyes.

"We only gave you a job and food, and you're so grateful. You should be even more grateful to your parents. After all, they brought you into this world." Aunt Zhang felt that Su Yuqing's mental state might be problematic.  Out of a woman's nature, she began to patiently counsel her.

"Um..." Su Yuqing didn't respond.  She actually wished she hadn't been born into this world, then she wouldn't have such a conflicted self. Why did her parents give her a boy's body?

But these things couldn't be told to others. Su Yuqing could only keep them hidden in her heart, pretending nothing was wrong on the surface.

"Xiaoqing, you seem to have something on your mind. If you don't mind, tell Aunt."

"Nothing..." Su Yuqing shook her head. Even though Aunt Zhang was a kind person, she didn't intend to tell her about these things, because what she wanted to do was too shocking, too appalling for ordinary people...

A boy who wants to become a girl? In many people's eyes, this is a sacrilege, the behavior of a madman.

But then again, does any boy who wants to be a girl not have some mental illness?

This interruption ruined the delicious noodles.  They tasted like wax in Su Yuqing's mouth, and the atmosphere became silent.

The silence didn't last long, however, as customers soon arrived.

The noodle shop also served breakfast. Although it didn't have as many options as a typical breakfast shop, offering only mixed noodles, wontons, and dumplings, there were quite a few customers. No wonder the shop owner needed a helper.

Su Yuqing's job was simple: write down the customers' orders, tell the boss and boss's wife in the kitchen, deliver the food, and give the money to the proprietress.

It sounded simple, but it was actually very busy.

"Hey, boss, you hired a pretty little girl as a helper? Tsk tsk, that face, she's not even an adult, right?" A regular customer joked with a laugh.

Li's voice came from the small window outside the kitchen. He also laughed, "Yeah, look, isn't she pretty? How about you let her be your son's wife?"

"Hey, that's great." The middle-aged man looked at Su Yuqing and asked with a smile, "Little girl, would you like to be my son's wife? If you become my wife, you won't have to work, we'll support you."

"Haha! Old Wang's business is booming again, huh?"

"Old Wang, what are you joining in on? Your son is only a few years old, younger than this girl!"

"Hey, maybe Old Wang wants to marry this girl as a young wife?"

The regular customers joked.

Su Yuqing's face turned red. She stammered to the middle-aged man, "Ple-please... what would you like to order..."

"A large bowl of wontons, extra scallions."

"Uncle Li, large wontons, extra scallions."

"What?" The noodle shop was too noisy; Li, who was busy in the kitchen, couldn't hear Su Yuqing clearly, partly because Su Yuqing's voice was too soft.

"Large wontons... extra scallions..." Su Yuqing put her hand on her throat and tried to shout loudly.

Perhaps because she hadn't spoken loudly for a long time, even though she tried to shout, her voice wasn't loud.  Luckily, Aunt Zhang, who was nearby, heard and relayed it to Li. Su Yuqing finally relaxed. That loud shout made her throat feel uncomfortable.

"Xiaoqing, take this mixed noodles to the table."

"Oh."

Su Yuqing carried the mixed noodles and carefully walked to a waiting customer. Though it was only a short time, she didn't forget who ordered it, but to be safe, Su Yuqing still asked, "Is this your mixed noodles?" After receiving an affirmative answer, she placed the noodles on the table in front of him.

The entire morning was quite busy. Su Yuqing didn't know how many bowls of mixed noodles, wontons, and dumplings she had served...

She felt mentally numb, sometimes even when no one ordered anything, she would subconsciously walk to the kitchen and wanted to say who ordered what.  Just as she was about to speak, she remembered that no one had ordered anything...

The breakfast rush was lively but short. After 8:30 am, fewer and fewer customers came for breakfast. By 9:00 am, the noodle shop was completely quiet, with not a single customer.

Su Yuqing finally got a short break.  Though it was only a few hours, running around the shop was tiring. Su Yuqing felt the blisters on her feet hurt even more, they hadn't healed from yesterday...

At this rate, she would probably get calluses...

"Tired?" Aunt Zhang looked at Su Yuqing, who was slumped in a chair, and asked with a smile.

"Um... my feet hurt so much..."

"You'll get used to it."

Although Su Yuqing was pretty, in Aunt Zhang's eyes, she was still a boy. For the older generation, it's nothing for a boy to suffer a little hardship, or rather, it's something they should endure on their way to grow up.

"Um..." Su Yuqing nodded lightly. Although she wanted to be a girl, it didn't mean she wanted to be looked down upon. She also knew that this job wasn't that tiring, it's just that her body was too delicate.

Hard work brings rewards.

"Xiaoqing, wipe the tables after you've rested."

"Okay..."

Su Yuqing gritted her teeth and stood up, grabbing a rag and carefully wiping the tables.

Earning money to support herself wasn't as easy as she imagined.

Su Yuqing still saw everything too easily.

Fortunately, the noodle shop wouldn't have much business until noon. After Su Yuqing finished wiping the tables, she could finally rest for a while. The bowls were piled up to be washed in the afternoon, because the afternoon had a longer period of little business.

After finishing her work, Su Yuqing sat down near the shop entrance, where a gentle breeze occasionally blew, but it wasn't too cold.

The chair was a little high. Su Yuqing had to tiptoe to touch the ground. She sat there, gently swaying her body, enjoying the warm sunlight-heated breeze, swinging her legs up and down, looking relaxed.

After working hard and then resting, this feeling of stealing half a day of leisure was too wonderful...

"Hello, is there any breakfast left?" A disheveled young man walked into the noodle shop and shouted.

"What would you like to order?" Su Yuqing quickly stood up from her chair and asked.

The disheveled man looked at Su Yuqing questioningly and asked, "Are you... the boss?"

"..."

"What would you like?" Aunt Zhang came to the rescue, as the taciturn Su Yuqing didn't know how to answer his question.

"Mixed noodles with a fried egg and a bowl of wontons."

"Young man, you have a good appetite!" Li laughed.

"I'm hungry, so my appetite is naturally good." The disheveled young man smiled slightly and sat down at the table next to Su Yuqing.

"Are you working here?" he asked.

"Um..."

"...Working is hard, you have to work hard." Unexpectedly, the disheveled young man didn't ask Su Yuqing's age but simply said that.

Su Yuqing looked at the man, who seemed strange to her, with some confusion. She felt like she had seen him somewhere.

Well, maybe it was just a mistake.

She decided not to dwell on things she couldn't figure out, as they didn't concern her. After Su Yuqing served the mixed noodles and wontons to the disheveled young man, she sat back on her chair and squinted her eyes, enjoying herself.

Although the work was a bit tiring, if she got used to it, this kind of life would be pretty good, right?
