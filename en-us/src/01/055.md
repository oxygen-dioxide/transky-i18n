# 55 Â· Two Budding "Girls"

"Little sister, what's your name?" the strong man asked gently.

His immediate familiarity made Su Yuqing uncomfortable.

But she still answered, "Su Yuqing."

"Su Yuqing...? Su from Suzhou?"

"Uh-huh... Yu as in rain, Qing as in sunny..." Su Yuqing patiently explained.  Only someone as mild-mannered as she would have the patience; other girls might not even bother to respond.

After all, most people are wary of strangers. If a stranger acts overly familiar, most would be on guard.

"What a pretty name..." The strong man repeated Su Yuqing's name, sighing with emotion. "My name is Hu Yuniu. Hu as in gossip, Yu as in jade, Niu as in ox."

"Um..." Su Yuqing nodded lightly, unsure how to respond.

His name was rather odd.  Hu Niu would sound quite fierce, but adding a "Yu" in the middle inexplicably added a strange gentleness...

One might say it's a balance of yin and yang; another might say... neither male nor female?

Su Yuqing pinched the corner of her eye, dismissing the thought.

It's wrong to judge others like that, especially since Su Yuqing herself was... well... she had no right to judge others.

Although her thought wasn't malicious, merely a mental categorization of his name...

"Nice to meet you. We're friends now, right?" Hu Yuniu smiled at Su Yuqing.

"Ah... um..."

"I live in that village. The red four-story building is my house. If you need help, you can come find me, if I can help."

"Um... thank you..." Sometimes, Su Yuqing found it hard to resist the simplicity of rural people. Perhaps it was their directness compared to city dwellers.

"I'll pick some more flowers and go back. Be careful on your way back."

"Okay..." Su Yuqing didn't want to stay longer.  She wasn't close to Hu Yuniu; who knew his true intentions? You can't judge a book by its cover, maybe this was just a way to lower her guard?

"Yuqing, Yuqing, don't always think the worst of people..." Su Yuqing patted her cheeks, muttering to herself.

Hu Yuniu, with his muscular arms, gently picked flower after flower...

Hesitating, Su Yuqing bid farewell to Hu Yuniu, jogging around a bend. Only when she could no longer see him did she slow down.

Was Hu Yuniu still a student or already working? It was Monday, so if he was a student, he shouldn't be at the Confucian Temple. But if he wasn't a student, why worship Confucius...? Was he just bored, like Su Yuqing?

Unconsciously, she arrived at the riverbank again.  Blown by the spring breeze, the grass was even more lush than last time, already covering her ankles.

Su Yuqing took off her shoes, walking barefoot on the grass.  The wind gently tickled her ankles, a comfortable itch.

To her surprise, someone was already sitting on the riverbank. The figure looked familiar...

The person, dressed in men's clothing, looked thin.

"Sisi jie?" Su Yuqing approached, calling softly, unsure.

There was no response. Su Yuqing thought she was wrong, but she went around to the person's front and secretly glanced at their face.

It was Zhang Sifan. His eyes were unfocused, lost in thought.

Probably daydreaming.

"Sisi jie?" Su Yuqing sat beside Zhang Sifan, gently nudging her, calling again.

Zhang Sifan snapped back to reality, looking at Su Yuqing with a dazed expression, taking three seconds to register.

"Eh? Xiaoqing? What are you doing here?"

"I have the day off, so I came out for a walk. What about Sisi jie?"

"Me too..."

"Why did Sisi jie come so far?"

"I have an e-bike, so I came to a farther place."

"Okay~ By the way, Sisi jie's e-bike is really durable, it doesn't run out of battery even after four hours."

"Of course, I bought a good one." Zhang Sifan looked down at Su Yuqing's tender white feet, envious. "Xiaoqing, your feet are so pretty... I wish I had such small feet."

"...uh, what size are Sisi jie's feet?"

"Size 38. It's small for a man, but it's considered large for a woman..."

"Um, okay..." Su Yuqing put on her shoes.  "Mine are size 35..."

"Eh~ I'm so envious!" Zhang Sifan suddenly pushed Su Yuqing onto the grass. The soft grass gently tickled her cheeks, itching her heart.

"Eh? Sisi jie?"

"Well... I really want to ravish you..." Zhang Sifan licked her lips with a mischievous smile. She was quite alluring doing this; any lovestruck girls would probably scream.

"..." Su Yuqing's face flushed red, like a bullied little wife.

"Shy? You're cute when you're shy!" Zhang Sifan pinched Su Yuqing's face, sitting back down, no longer teasing her.

"..." Su Yuqing sat up, brushing off the grass seeds, silent, embarrassed or unsure what to say.

"Xiaoqing..." After a moment of silence, the atmosphere returned to normal. Zhang Sifan sighed softly.

"Hm?"

"Do you think people like us can have love?"

"I... I don't know..." Su Yuqing pouted. "I don't even know what love feels like."

"Well... Xiaoqing, what do you think of him?"

"Him?"

"Sun Hao."

"Um..."

"What do you think?"

"To be honest... I don't like him very much."

"Why?"

"He seems scary... Unreadable..."

"You mean his inner self is different from his outward appearance?"

"Um... something like that." Su Yuqing nodded. She wanted to say "wolf in sheep's clothing," but judging someone based on a first impression was too superficial.

"I kind of feel that way too... I can't see through him, uh..."

"Does Sisi jie like him?"

"Like... I guess I like him..." Zhang Sifan hugged her legs, head down. "He's the first guy to confess to me... I do have some feelings... and he's good-looking..."

Like someone who hasn't had water for days in the desert suddenly meets someone willing to give them water. Although they can't see through the person, because of their kindness, they still have great affection.

"It might be just a psychological effect. People like us... lack security. Sisi jie, try trusting him completely." Although she didn't like Sun Hao, Su Yuqing patiently advised. It was Zhang Sifan's first love, precious.

"Um... I'm trying, but there's a knot in my heart, it's uncomfortable..."

"Is he good to you?"

"He's pretty good to me. He bought me a bag and an expensive wig..."

"That's good. As long as he truly loves you."

"Yeah..."

"Didn't he come with you today?"

"He went back already."

"Oh? Went back?"

"He lives in another city, he took the train to see me..."

"I see... How did Sisi jie meet him?"

"I read a novel, joined his reader group, and met him chatting. He thought I was a girl and chased me. Then... I told him the truth, he didn't give up, and came to see me..." Zhang Sifan smiled happily. "That's how it is. I was quite moved when he came..."

A rare love, and perhaps the first person to fully accept Zhang Sifan?

"Oh, I know why he makes me uncomfortable." Zhang Sifan tilted her head, thinking.

"Why?"

"He's sometimes gloomy, his novels are negative, and I feel he's possessive. When I chat on QQ, he always asks if I'm a boy or girl..."

"That's nothing. It means he cares about you."

"Ah... That's true..."

"Right, Sisi jie... that... that..."

"What?"

"That..." Su Yuqing blushed, fiddling with her fingers, asking softly, "Have you... you know..."

"You know?" Zhang Sifan was stunned, taking a few seconds to understand. She blushed, knocked Su Yuqing's head playfully, and scolded, "Little girl, what are you thinking about!"

"No..." Su Yuqing's face was red, whispering, "I want to know what it feels like..."

"Little girl, you're in love, aren't you?" Zhang Sifan, blushing, acted like a playboy, lightly lifting Su Yuqing's chin. "Humph, shall this king grace you?"
