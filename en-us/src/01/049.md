# 49 · Brave or Cowardly?

“Hey there, little thing, what’s the rush? The brothers here will make you comfortable!”  A green-haired thug leered, reaching out to grab Su Yuqing’s arm, pulling her back from her escape.

“I—I’m—I’m a man…” Su Yuqing stammered, her head down, avoiding the thug’s repulsive gaze.  But she didn’t realize that her display of weakness only made her seem more vulnerable.

In her heart, Su Yuqing was reluctant to admit she was a boy, but to escape, she repeated it several times.  Perhaps it was ironic?

Unwilling to admit it, yet relying on this identity for survival.

“A man?” The green-haired thug looked dubious. Initially, he didn’t believe it, but seeing Su Yuqing’s earnest expression, he was slightly taken aback.

“Haha! Greenie, man or woman, just feel it out!” the yellow-haired thug chimed in.

“Hey, it’s not like I haven’t felt it before.”  The green-haired thug, seemingly goaded, pinned Su Yuqing with one hand and reached toward her lower body with the other.

Su Yuqing struggled, but couldn’t escape the green-haired thug’s grasp; her strength was too weak.

The rough hand finally touched Su Yuqing’s genitals, making her jump.  Her struggle intensified, but she remained trapped.

“Damn it, bad luck, it’s really a guy!” the green-haired thug said, his face clouded. “A guy who looks like a woman!”

The white-haired thug took a drag of his cigarette, mockingly saying, “Greenie, you’re lucky!  Hey, you know, even if he’s a guy, it’s fine as a girl, right?”

“Damn it, I still don’t believe he’s a man.”

The yellow-haired thug grinned, giving Greenie an idea: “Why don’t you take off his pants, Greenie, and see if he’s got a… you know?”

“You guys hold him down! I’m gonna see for myself!”

Su Yuqing bit her lip, her expression a mix of panic and anger.  These thugs were talking amongst themselves, not seeing her as a person, but as an object.

And… and they were going to take off her pants—a blatant humiliation!

Su Yuqing clenched her fist, remembering similar past abuse.  She didn’t want to endure that humiliation again.  She knew she was too weak…

Su Yuqing gasped for air, suddenly raising her head.  From where she found the strength, she punched the green-haired thug on the nose.  He cried out, clutching his nose, blood streaming down.

“Ugh… ugh…” Su Yuqing felt her right hand ache. She normally couldn’t muster that much strength; that punch had used up most of her energy.

“Damn it, Dog White, Two Yellow, grab this son of a bitch!” the green-haired thug roared.

Su Yuqing wanted to run, but her legs trembled.  She watched the two thugs charge towards her, unable to move.

Su Yuqing was cowardly.  Even after punching the green-haired thug, her fear hadn't subsided.  Terror consumed her, paralyzing her.

Then, Su Yuqing was pinned down by the white-haired and yellow-haired thugs—onto the cold, hard concrete.

The back of Su Yuqing’s head hit the ground.  While not knocked unconscious, the sudden, sharp pain made her dizzy.

Her white baseball cap fell to the side.

“Short hair? Really a guy?”

“What’s so strange about that?  Lots of girls have this hairstyle.  Come on, Greenie, let’s check those pants!”

“Damn… you bitch…” The green-haired thug pulled a tissue from his pocket, stuffing it in his nose to stop the bleeding.  He looked ridiculous, fueling his anger.  “Damn it, you ruined my handsome face!”

“Ah!” Just as the green-haired thug was about to pull down Su Yuqing’s pants, a scream came from the alley’s corner.

Su Yuqing grasped at this lifeline, her spirits lifting.  Though unable to see who it was, she weakly cried, “Help… help me…”

“Damn it, kid, don’t want to die, get lost!” the green-haired thug yelled, his head raised, his fury evident.  He’d been punched, and was a powder keg ready to explode.

A fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy entered the alley, about Su Yuqing’s age, with unremarkable features; the kind who blended into a crowd.  In a movie, he’d be an extra.

The boy, yelled at by the green-haired thug, paled, stepping back.  Sweat beaded on his forehead.  His fists were clenched, but he seemed weak and hesitant.

“Scram!” the white-haired thug also yelled.

The ordinary-looking boy’s eyes twitched, his body trembling, seemingly struggling to control his emotions, wanting to be a hero.

Su Yuqing felt a flicker of hope.  Even one person against three meant a chance to escape…

The yellow-haired thug looked at the ordinary-looking boy, preparing for a fight.  He rubbed his nose, beckoning the boy with a finger.  “Hey, kid, come on, one hand’s enough for you.”

Unexpectedly, the seemingly furious boy turned and fled, like a startled rabbit.

“Damn, thought he was something, turns out he’s a wimp.”  The yellow-haired thug said regretfully, pinning Su Yuqing again.

Su Yuqing felt despair. No one would save her. This wasn't a movie, but brutal reality…

Su Yuqing saw the darkness of society:  evil rampant and arrogant, even good people, lacking strength, could only endure, and most people were indifferent, minding their own business—the survival rule of most in this society.  Those who sacrificed for justice perhaps didn't exist…

Finally, unimpeded, Su Yuqing’s pants were pulled down.  She felt her lower body exposed to the cold air, a shiver running through her, but the coldest was her heart.

“Damn it, really a guy!”

“Bad luck.”

“Hey, why doesn’t Greenie try the guy? I think it’s fine.”

“Damn it, you try it yourself.”

“Fine, I’ll do it.  I’ve been wanting to try it.”  The white-haired thug said, pulling down his pants, squatting beside Su Yuqing, and grabbing her soft… “Hairless, perfect.”

“Damn it, hurry up, so disgusting.”  The green-haired thug replaced the white-haired one, pinning Su Yuqing down.

Actually, even without pinning her down, there would be little resistance. Su Yuqing’s strength was almost depleted; even standing up would be difficult…

“What are you doing!” A shout echoed, followed by the sound of running footsteps. Five or six security guards, wielding batons, burst in.

The three thugs were startled, the yellow-haired one frantically pulling up his pants and fleeing.

“Damn!  Police!”

“Shit, run!”

In their panic, the thugs mistook the security guards’ uniforms for police uniforms.  It wasn’t surprising; the alley was dimly lit, and the situation was urgent…

Su Yuqing, using her remaining strength, pulled up her pants when the white-haired thug stood.  She lay weakly on the ground.

“Little girl, are you alright?!” A security guard helped her up, asking concernedly.

“I’m… fine… Thank… thank you…” Su Yuqing nodded quietly, then discreetly slipped away from the guard’s arm, picking up her hat and putting it back on.

“Good. Little girl, next time, walk on the main road at night.  We were lucky a young man told us, otherwise…”

“Okay… thank you…” Su Yuqing thanked the guards and escaped.

She should have been more polite, but Su Yuqing didn’t want to stay in that alley, which felt like a hell that consumed souls.

Su Yuqing left the alley, returning to the bustling street, and saw the ordinary-looking boy leaning against a wall, gasping for breath, sweat streaming down his face, not from exertion, but from fear—like someone who’d forced themselves to watch a horror movie, his appearance afterwards.

“…” The boy glanced at Su Yuqing, seeming relieved, letting go of the wall and walking towards the street.

“That…” Su Yuqing asked softly, “Were… were you… the one who saved me?”

“No… it was those… security guards.” The boy’s voice was stiff and tense, as if he wasn’t used to talking to people.

“Thank you…”

The boy didn’t respond; he’d already left, disappearing from Su Yuqing’s sight.

Was he brave or cowardly?

Or both?

Su Yuqing pondered, her startled heart slowly calming.

Even in panic, he’d made a rational judgment.

Why couldn’t she? Su Yuqing thought about her actions.  If she’d been more alert, acted sooner, she might have escaped.  After the punch, if she’d run immediately, she could have escaped. Everything stemmed from her inner fear.

The greatest enemy wasn’t others, but her own heart…
