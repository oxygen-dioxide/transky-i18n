# 35 · Meeting

The central square of this small city is somewhat similar to Hangzhou's Wushan Square, also built against a mountain.  However, this mountain is shorter and flatter, more accurately described as a large mound. From above, it resembles a giant grave marker.

This is arguably the busiest area of the small city.  The mountainside adjacent to the central square is dotted with buildings, including a small seven- or eight-story office building.

The central square is almost entirely surrounded by office buildings, with various large shopping malls and specialty stores nearby. If you can't find what you're looking for here, you probably won't find it anywhere in the city.

Despite being a small city, the city center boasts fairly comprehensive facilities.

Following the sanitation worker's directions, Su Yuqing easily found the main entrance to the central square. Compared to the bustling streets, it was relatively empty. It was Monday; on weekends, numerous stalls would be set up in the open space. In this day and age, that's the primary method for product promotion.

While the most bustling spot in the small city, it still paled in comparison to Hangzhou's city center.  For Su Yuqing, who had seen the world, it wasn't particularly surprising... but it was still quite large, and her poor sense of direction was causing her some anxiety.

First, she needed to find a jewelry store.  Since Yue Cheng only mentioned a jewelry store and not a specific name, there should only be one in the central square...

Su Yuqing looked around.  The time was still early, so she wasn't in a rush, strolling leisurely, a stark contrast to the hurried passersby.

Many people glanced at her as they passed, because a child her age should be at school at this time, not in the central square.

Feeling the various gazes, Su Yuqing shrunk her neck, hugged herself tightly, and lowered her head, letting the brim of her baseball cap shield her face. This lessened the feeling of being watched.

Yue Cheng had probably anticipated Su Yuqing's poor sense of direction, telling her the meeting place was near the main entrance.  She found it quickly.

"Um... in front of the jewelry store... a pine tree..." Su Yuqing slowly walked to the thick pine tree and leaned against it, taking a breath.

The walk had been tiring.

Though she had no watch or phone, there was a large clock tower at the edge of the square.  It might not be perfectly accurate, but it was a reference point.

The hour hand pointed to eight, the minute hand to six. It was 8:30 am, half an hour before their meeting.

Su Yuqing was patient when waiting, often arriving early and accustomed to waiting for others. Half an hour was nothing—though it would be better if there was somewhere to sit.

This pine tree looked ancient, its trunk so thick it would take at least three people to hug. It was lush and full, providing ample shelter from rain.

Behind Su Yuqing, a young man in a pale yellow baseball cap paced nervously, as if waiting for or contemplating something complex.

Even from the other side of the tree, Su Yuqing could hear the impatience in his steps.

Who could he be waiting for? A girlfriend?

Su Yuqing glanced back curiously. He seemed anxious. Only someone on a first date might look like that.

"Speaking of... Yue Cheng..." Su Yuqing murmured, gazing at the azure sky, "She wouldn't really wait until nine, would she...?"

The young man on the other side of the tree grew increasingly impatient, even starting to circle the thick pine.

Perhaps this helped relieve his anxiety?

Waiting was boring, so Su Yuqing inevitably started imagining what the girl he was waiting for looked like...

Maybe he wasn't waiting for a girl, but someone more important? Like... parents? Or... a boyfriend?

Huh? Boyfriend?

Su Yuqing cautiously glanced at the circling young man, confirming he hadn't noticed her thoughts, then quickly lowered her head.

Um... Su Yuqing hadn't seen many BL movies or comics, but she had read novels.  Boredom led her to fantasize about the plot, especially since the young man seemed handsome and possessed a certain "uke" quality...

This thought made Su Yuqing feel a little hot. She coughed to distract herself.

The circling young man, hearing her cough, subconsciously looked up.

Initially, he didn't notice anything unusual. After glancing at Su Yuqing, he continued circling. But on his next round, he stopped, a look of confusion, shyness, and excitement on his face.

He looked at Su Yuqing's pretty face, then at her oversized men's clothing, seeming to confirm his suspicions...

Finally, when Su Yuqing, embarrassed, turned away, he spoke cautiously.

"Excuse me... are you... Quan...?" His voice was pleasant, clear with a hint of fragility, like a frail scholar from ancient times.

"Huh?" Su Yuqing froze, then quickly turned back, excitedly looking at him. "You are... Yue, Yue, Yue..."

"Yue Cheng," the young man finished for her, happily walking to her side.  "Are you really Qingquan?"

"It's me..." Su Yuqing tilted her head, looking up at Yue Cheng, not because Yue Cheng was too tall, but because Su Yuqing was too short—barely five feet tall, making her have to look up at most people...

"Wow... it's really you... hey... you don't seem to be wearing makeup, do you?"

"Um... no..."

"So pretty... so cute! Really cute! Even cuter than I imagined! I was prepared for 'you might be different from what I imagined'!  This is a surprise!" Yue Cheng said in wonder and admiration.

"Uh... uh... uh..."  Although they were close online, the reality of meeting face-to-face made Su Yuqing incredibly nervous.

"Don't be so nervous... you're nothing like your online persona." Yue Cheng chuckled, appearing quite relaxed.

"No... no... no..."

"Okay, okay, take a deep breath, calm down, don't be so nervous."

"Mm..." Su Yuqing nodded obediently, took a deep breath, closed her eyes for a moment, and then slowly opened them.  "Um... Yue Cheng?"

"Ah, what's wrong? Not stuttering anymore?"

"Um... much better..." Su Yuqing smiled in relief. She disliked her stutter, but couldn't seem to get rid of it...

Luckily, Yue Cheng was a familiar online friend. Although initially strange and nerve-wracking, after a few words, she relaxed. Around familiar friends, Su Yuqing was more lively.

"Speaking of, I've seen you before." Yue Cheng smiled mysteriously.

"Huh? Where?"

"Um... at that noodle shop. I thought, 'How can such a cute boy be a boy?', and had some... other thoughts. I didn't expect you to be a boy! And my familiar Qingquan!" Yue Cheng said excitedly.

"Huh? So you're the lecherous..." Su Yuqing stopped herself, awkwardly laughing and coughing to cover her embarrassment.  "Ahem!"

"Oh~ You wanted to say I'm a lech, right~" Yue Cheng grinned, pinching Su Yuqing's smooth cheek.  Her face was now completely clear, smooth and tender like a newborn's.

"No... no..." Su Yuqing blushed.

Su Yuqing also thought this "lecherous" person was unusual back then.  She was actually a boy...

"By the way, Qingquan, you're so pretty, why don't you wear women's clothing? Even in men's clothing, people can't tell..."

"Um... I... didn't bring much... and I have short hair now." Su Yuqing smiled helplessly.

"Oh..."

"Um, Yue Cheng, what's your name? I can't keep calling you Yue Cheng..." Su Yuqing looked around awkwardly. "It feels a little strange..."

"Um, call me Zhang Sifan."

"Zhang Sifan...?  Should I call you Sister Si Si?"

"Huh? I'm in men's clothing now, I didn't expect you, little 'girl', to be so scheming!"

"Ahem! Um, my name is Su Yuqing, Su from Suzhou, Yu from rain, Qing from clear sky."

"Is that your girl's name?" Zhang Sifan asked.

"Huh? It's my real name."

"With a name like that, you're really not a girl?"

"...At least... not right now."

"Okay, okay, Xiaoqing, let's go for a walk. I'm very familiar with this small city!"

"Okay!"

...
