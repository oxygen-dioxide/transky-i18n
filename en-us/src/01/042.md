# 42 · Picnic

"Let's go outside."

"Huh? Outside?" Su Yuqing felt a little nervous, because she had never worn women's clothing outside before.

"Shy?" Zhang Sifan teased, smiling, "Just outside the house, on this patch of grass."

"Oh, that's okay..." Su Yuqing breathed a sigh of relief. If she had to go out on the street, she would have been terrified, although she did have a little bit of expectation in her heart...

Although this place was rather secluded, it wasn't too far from the nearby villages. Zhang Sifan usually went to the small restaurants in the nearby villages to buy some food, and sometimes, if she was too lazy to go out, she would cook something on the grass in front of her house.  She had a refrigerator, so she could buy some frozen food in advance.

Like dumplings, frozen meat, zongzi… that kind of food.

"Xiaoqing, if you ride your electric bike straight ahead from here, you'll reach your place." Zhang Sifan pointed to a narrow path in front of them.

"Is it close?"

"Um... about two hours by bike."

"So far..."

"Yeah, but it's close! It's closer than from here to the central square. After all, your place is on the edge of the city, pretty close to the suburbs."

Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan chatted casually as they walked out of the small house converted from a shipping container.

The lush green grass swayed in the wind, and gusts of cool breeze brushed against Su Yuqing's face, warm and slightly moist.

The sun was still bright, but not as harsh as before. It was gradually setting; it must have been around three or four in the afternoon.

Wearing a skirt and walking on this patch of grass, even though there was no one around, gave Su Yuqing a strange feeling of nervousness.  It was completely different from wearing men's clothes. Especially when the wind blew, her lower body felt a little chilly, making her unconsciously press her hand lightly on the hem of her skirt, afraid that the mischievous wind would suddenly lift it up.

Um… the feeling…  insecure…

But she didn't reject it; on the contrary, she liked it even more.  It wasn't strange; a boy who always wanted to be a girl wouldn't hate wearing a skirt, or rather, he always wanted to wear one, right?

After getting used to it, wearing a skirt felt quite comfortable, making her feel cool. The wind blew directly into her clothes from below, and every pore would comfortably expand…

"Sis Si, if you fence this area, you could make a yard." Su Yuqing said dreamily. If she could, she really hoped to live in a place like this…

"I'm planning to do that. Although an acre isn't big, I haven't used all the land for this container.  Making a yard shouldn't be a problem.  I could grow flowers, vegetables, and stuff like that later…" Zhang Sifan also looked yearning.

"Sis Si also likes that kind of pastoral life?"

"I can't say I've experienced that kind of life, but I think it's interesting.  If you really made me live a life without computers or cell phones, busy with farm work all day long, I wouldn't want to."

"Mmm… that's true…" Su Yuqing imagined herself sweating profusely from farm work, and shrunk her neck in fear, "And I'd get sunburned…"

"Exactly, so this is good enough."

The bottom of the container was raised on a frame, so there was some space underneath, cluttered with various odds and ends.

"Xiaoqing, help me carry this out." Zhang Sifan pointed to an all-metal outdoor fire pit.

"Okay."

The two of them worked together, struggling to move the fire pit.

The fire pit looked like a giant bowl, with a structure similar to a grill, but its function wasn't limited to grilling food; it could also be used as a stove. It was about half Su Yuqing's height.

"Right… put it down here… good…"

"Whew… so heavy…" Su Yuqing patted her aching arm, "Sis Si, do you usually carry it by yourself?"

"Yes, but it's slower by myself, and it's too heavy. I usually don't want to use it…" Zhang Sifan squeezed her arm muscles, "My arms always ache after carrying it… it's really too heavy…"

Actually, the fire pit wasn't that heavy, but because Zhang Sifan and Su Yuqing were both physically weak, they felt it was tiring. If it was a strong adult man, he could easily move it, even carry it on his shoulder and run…

"Is this a picnic?" Su Yuqing moved a small chair and sat beside the fire pit, watching Zhang Sifan take food out of the refrigerator with great interest, and asked.

"Yeah, I guess so." Zhang Sifan glanced at the small forest behind the house and nodded lightly.

The picnic food was all frozen food from the refrigerator, and some food with a long shelf life, such as canned goods and sausages…

The fire pit could be divided into four sections; one was used for boiling hot pot, and the other three were used as grills.

"Um… there aren't any fresh vegetables; only a large cabbage and some rice cakes."

"That's good enough." Su Yuqing smiled faintly. She wasn't picky about food, and besides, today's food was much better than what she had eaten since coming to this small city.

Although the meals at the noodle shop were pretty good, there definitely wouldn't be this much meat and vegetables.

After all… there's no rice today, the only staple food is a little rice cake…

Zhang Sifan put the hot pot seasoning into the pot, boiled it, and then threw in the cabbage, rice cakes, dumplings, etc., then placed the other ready-made meat slices on the grill.

The so-called ready-made meat slices were actually marinated meat slices, just put them on the fire and grill them until they were cooked.

The fuel was charcoal. This wouldn't be cheap to buy in Hangzhou, but here in the countryside, Zhang Sifan didn't even have to buy it; she just needed to ask other farmers for some.

"Hey hey, enough, enough, too much, we can't finish it all!" Su Yuqing saw Zhang Sifan pouring a whole bag of meatballs into the hot pot, and worriedly persuaded.

"Relax, we can finish it." Zhang Sifan patted her chest. Unfortunately, there was no thump-thump sound, because her chest hurt, making her frown, "Don't look at me like this; I actually have a huge appetite."

"Huh? But Sis Si, you're so thin."

"I have a constitution that doesn't gain weight, envious?"

Su Yuqing nodded. She didn't know what kind of constitution she had, but she couldn't eat much; she would get full after just a little, and if she only ate a little, she wouldn't gain weight easily, right?

Zhang Sifan seemed very skilled at grilling, calmly flipping the meat slices, and still had time to add ingredients to the hot pot, and her mouth never stopped…

Eating barbecue under this azure sky was truly the most wonderful enjoyment in life.

Su Yuqing ate slowly because she didn't want to get full too quickly, so she chewed slowly and savored the taste of each dish.

"Xiaoqing, you eat so elegantly…" Zhang Sifan's movements weren't rough, but she also ate in big mouthfuls, naturally not as elegant as Su Yuqing, who could take ten minutes to eat a single piece of meat.

"Huh?" Su Yuqing blushed slightly. Praise always made her feel embarrassed, "It's just… a habit developed since childhood…"

Zhang Sifan blinked in surprise and asked, "Did your parents raise you as a girl since childhood?"

"How is that possible…" Su Yuqing shook her head with a wry smile.

"Yeah, if that were the case… um, sorry…"

"It's okay, my family upbringing is like that. We have quite a lot of family rules."

"Huh? Family?" Zhang Sifan immediately became interested. She stuffed a meatball into her mouth and asked vaguely, "Tell me, what kind of rules?"

"It's like this… actually, living in a large family isn't necessarily happy. There are a lot of rules and regulations to follow… very annoying." Su Yuqing obviously didn't want to say more and vaguely evaded.

"Like, old-fashioned?"

"I guess so…"

"That's really annoying… I've met some older people who can't use cell phones and complain that the times are changing too fast…"

"Actually, it's quite normal. Sometimes it's not that they don't want to keep up with the times, but they might not be able to. After all, they're old."

"That's right. Xiaoqing, tell me, what's your family like?" Zhang Sifan flatteringly handed Su Yuqing a grilled chicken wing that was golden brown and crispy.

"Okay, okay…" Su Yuqing couldn't resist Zhang Sifan's enthusiasm, took the grilled chicken wing she gave her, took a small bite, then slowly chewed for a while, and after finishing the food in her mouth, she slowly spoke.

"My family… has its own mountain. This is a 'fiefdom' that has been passed down from hundreds of years ago. It was during the Qing Dynasty, I think.  At that time, our family's clan leader was a minor official, and he made some merits, so he was given a small mountain. Before that, our family… no, before that, we didn't have a family, and then a system was formed."

"So you're Manchu?"

"…No." Su Yuqing shook her head, "It's said that the first clan leader saved some high-ranking official, and thus obtained noble status."

"So that's how it is. Speaking of which, at that time, Han people should all be commoners or even slaves, right?"

"Yeah." Su Yuqing nodded lightly and continued, "There's nothing fun about our place, it's just a mountain. There's a family shrine on the top of the mountain, where the family tree and stuff are enshrined. Every Chinese New Year, we have to go back to the family to celebrate the New Year. There are a lot of messy things… and the family is large, so people are not harmonious, although nominally they are relatives…"

Su Yuqing sighed, seeming unwilling to say more.

"Anyway, I hate my family."
