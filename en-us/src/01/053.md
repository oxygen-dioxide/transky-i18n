# 53 · Spring Festival

April, the most beautiful time of spring, is one of the most comfortable times of the year. By late spring in June, the weather gets very hot, and in early spring, it's still quite cold...

So if you want to go out and play in the spring, April is indeed a good time.

These days, I've seen people walking towards that unfinished road.  They say there's a Confucius Temple behind the fields beside that road, and these people are going to worship there.  Most of them are students hoping for good grades this year, or those taking the middle school or college entrance exams, hoping to get into a good school.

Besides students, there are also quite a few elderly people, but most of them are praying for their grandchildren. It's a small custom in this small city, a branch of the spring festival. Only in spring will many people go; usually, that road is quite deserted.

With people going to the spring festival, business on this street has improved quite a bit.  It's almost a whole day of work, from morning till night, without a moment's rest.

"One bowl of Zha Jiang Mian, to go."

"Ah, okay..." Su Yuqing had just served a bowl of noodles when someone walked into the noodle shop and said to her. This wasn't the end; as soon as this person finished speaking, three more people came in and ordered three different bowls of noodles.

"Sorry... could you repeat your orders?" Su Yuqing asked awkwardly. It wasn't that she couldn't remember; she had just been a little distracted, thinking about other things.

The four people repeated their orders, and Su Yuqing finally remembered them. She ran into the kitchen to tell Aunt Zhang and Mr. Li, afraid she would forget again.

Lately, Su Yuqing has been spacing out unconsciously, her reactions are a bit slow, and her memory seems to have gotten much worse...

Just now, Su Yuqing was thinking about Zhang Sifan and Sun Hao, wondering whether Zhang Sifan finding a boy who likes her is good news or bad news...

And what will Zhang Sifan do with Sun Hao?

Um... cough!

Have they slept together in bed?

"No, no, why am I thinking about this... even if they're together, they don't necessarily have to... you know!" Su Yuqing's pretty face flushed red, and she muttered to herself in a low voice.

"Xiaoqing, Xiaoqing."

"Ah?"

"Xiaoqing, what are you mumbling about? I've called you several times, and you didn't respond."

"Um... sorry..." Su Yuqing lowered her head, as if apologizing, actually trying to cover up the embarrassing things she had just been thinking about. Although others didn't know what she was thinking, she felt a little guilty.

"Take this fried noodle dish out, Xiaoqing. You seem a bit absent-minded lately. Is something on your mind?"

"No... nothing..." Su Yuqing touched her ear, covering up her guilt.

Fortunately, Aunt Zhang didn't press further, and Su Yuqing, relieved, took the plate and went out.

"Fried noodles... fried noodles... who ordered the fried noodles...?" Su Yuqing looked at those people who didn't have food in front of them and those waiting for takeout, her brain working rapidly, trying to remember who ordered the fried noodles...

However, it was as if that part of the memory had been torn up and thrown into the trash can. Even if she had a little impression, she couldn't remember who ordered it...

Luckily, the person who ordered the fried noodles looked up at Su Yuqing, who was standing still. He seemed to have noticed her predicament, or perhaps he was getting impatient. He asked, "Where's my fried noodles?"

"Ah... here..." Su Yuqing was like she had grabbed a life-saving straw, quickly went over and handed the fried noodles to the customer.

It was a busy time, non-stop. Even when busy, there would usually be a break at 3 PM, but today, there wasn't even a break. She worked until 9 PM.

Su Yuqing yawned widely, her tight-strung energy finally relaxing.

"Tomorrow is Monday... finally a day off..."

When people are very tired, they can fall asleep even if they lie on the roadside. Su Yuqing felt this way now; she wanted to fall asleep immediately.

These days, Cookie often came to the noodle shop where Su Yuqing worked to see her. Sometimes, they went out together; sometimes, she would come to see her at noon and then leave...

Sometimes, she would wait for her at the entrance of the alley in the evening when she got off work.

"Meow~" Cookie, perched on the wall, stretched languidly and gracefully jumped down from the wall, landing beside Su Yuqing.

"Um... Cookie..." Su Yuqing rubbed her eyes and greeted weakly.  She just wanted to go home, take a comfortable bath, and crawl into bed...

Today was exceptionally tiring. Perhaps because she knew she could sleep in tomorrow, the desire to go to bed was especially strong?

"Meow—" Cookie raised its front paw and scratched Su Yuqing's pants leg, then looked at her with bright blue eyes.

"Um...? Cookie... you go by yourself... I'm so tired today, I can't carry you..." Su Yuqing smiled weakly, patted Cookie's head, and staggered towards her front door.

The sound of the key entering the keyhole was crisp; with the rotation of the key, the keyhole clicked.

Su Yuqing was almost unable to keep her eyes open. She stood at the door, feeling like she was falling into a dream, or maybe still awake...

She went into the bathroom, took a bath, and unexpectedly found that she wasn't very sleepy.  She washed her clothes as well, then lay down on the bed...

"Meow, meow~" As soon as Su Yuqing closed her eyes, a furry paw stretched out in front of her. Cookie was looking at Su Yuqing with some concern, while Coffee was cleverly darting around on Cookie.

Su Yuqing sleepily opened her eyes to look at Cookie, but found that the ceiling seemed a little far away, and the warm quilt didn't seem to be on her bed...

"Um?" Su Yuqing sleepily reached out, but touched the cold floor.

It turned out that she had just been dreaming...

And she fell to the ground while dreaming, and she didn't even feel it. She only felt a little pain in her shoulder after waking up...

Fortunately, she landed on her shoulder first; if she had landed on her head, it would have been much more painful...

Su Yuqing stood up helplessly, shook her head to make herself a little more awake. Her brain had almost no thinking ability; she just thought about taking a bath quickly and then going to sleep.

Cookie and Coffee were lying on the chairs in front of the desk, watching Su Yuqing, wrapped in a bath towel, come out after her bath. Without even putting on her clothes, she randomly wiped her hair half-dry with the towel and then went straight into the bed.

This was the first time since Su Yuqing started living alone that she hadn't washed her clothes before bed.

She was just too tired; washing clothes could wait until tomorrow...

Because she was too tired, Su Yuqing didn't even turn off the light. She curled up in the quilt and fell asleep with a deep sense of drowsiness.

"Click." Finally, Cookie jumped onto the headboard and turned off the light for Su Yuqing.

The room was immediately plunged into darkness, with only a faint, hazy light from the streetlights outside.

Tonight, a thick layer of clouds covered the sky, and the moon and stars were invisible. Only the brightest North Star was faintly twinkling.

Cookie squatted on the desk, pressing down on Coffee's short tail with one paw, preventing it from "exploring" Su Yuqing's bed.

A black cat, like a guardian god, quietly watched Su Yuqing. Its blue eyes were as pure and clear as gems, but at the same time, it was impossible to fathom its inner thoughts, like a dry well without the slightest ripple.

An ordinary night passed like this.

Perhaps she was too tired; Su Yuqing didn't dream all night and slept until dawn.

When she opened her eyes, the sun was shining brightly on her, and Cookie and Coffee were lying on the desk fast asleep.  Animals are very sensitive, though. As soon as Su Yuqing opened her eyes, Cookie shook its ears, and Coffee simply stood up from the desk.

It seemed they hadn't left all night.

"Ugh..." Su Yuqing struggled to get out of bed, feeling as if all the bones in her body had been crushed and then healed again...

It took a lot of effort to even move a finger.

"Whew..." Su Yuqing reached out and touched Cookie, which was lying on the table. The latter docilely rubbed its head against her palm. It was itchy, making Su Yuqing feel very comfortable.

Su Yuqing wanted to sleep until the afternoon, but a single life wasn't that simple and easy. She had to do everything herself. At the very least, she had to wash her clothes.  The sun was so bright today; it would be a waste not to hang them out to dry. She also had to take the quilt out to sun it; she hadn't sunned it since she bought it, and it felt a little damp.

But once she got up, she got up. While lying in bed, she still wanted to sleep, but once she got up, most of her drowsiness dissipated.

After washing her face and brushing her teeth, she already felt refreshed.

Washing clothes in the small bathroom was really inconvenient. Su Yuqing could only rub them slowly bit by bit, using a brush for the stubborn stains...

"The weather is so nice today..." Su Yuqing murmured to herself as she hung out the clothes, looking at the blue sky.

"Maybe... I'll go for a walk?"

She'd follow the route of those people who went to the spring festival and take a look. Anyway, the spring festival was almost over, and there shouldn't be many people on that road.  And today is Monday; perhaps no one would be going.

Su Yuqing didn't really like going to crowded places, but she couldn't contain her curiosity about what the Confucius Temple here looked like.

Ultimately, it's a lack of entertainment, right?  If there was a computer in this small house to play with, Su Yuqing probably wouldn't think about going for a walk...

"Um... I really want to buy a computer..."

"But... I can't even afford a phone now, let alone a computer..."

At this moment, Su Yuqing's heart yearned for money so much. It would be nice to have a lot of money to spend.
