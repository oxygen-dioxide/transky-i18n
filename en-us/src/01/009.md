# 9 · First Day of Work (Part 1)

“Cute?” The boss, a burly man with stubble, was clearly taken aback. He scratched the back of his head, seemingly unable to grasp a little girl’s standard of cuteness. After a moment’s thought, he pulled a comforter with alternating chocolate and white squares from a neatly stacked pile of blankets. “Little girl… how about this one?”

“Um… do you have anything prettier?”

“Then take a look.”

After browsing through the pile, only the chocolate and white checkered comforter seemed remotely appealing. The rest were old-fashioned, garishly red floral prints. Seeing them brought back memories of her grandmother’s house ten years ago; she seemed to recall using a similar blanket.

“Forget it, I’ll take this one.” Su Yuqing reluctantly chose the only decent-looking option.

“Alright, I’ll wrap it up for you. My daughter likes this color too, actually.”

“Seventy yuan, right?” Su Yuqing felt the single hundred-yuan bill in her pocket.

“Yes.”

Su Yuqing was about to pay, but then remembered the boss’s wife haggling with the delivery guy.

Every yuan was precious to Su Yuqing.  She should try to save wherever possible.  Why not haggle?  Every little bit helps.

Watching the boss fold the comforter into a large red plastic bag, Su Yuqing cleared her throat, recalling the bargaining techniques from TV dramas and her mother. After a moment of preparation, she said, “Seventy yuan… can you give me a discount?”

The words lacked any conviction. It didn’t sound like haggling, but rather a plea for charity.

It was Su Yuqing’s first time haggling, her face flushed slightly, as if bargaining were inherently dishonest.

“No discount, this is already cost price.”

“Then… okay.” Su Yuqing, who had just been planning to haggle, was now too nervous to continue. She simply nodded, relieved when the boss didn't say anything else.

Watching others bargain seemed so effortless, casually shaving off a significant amount from the price.  Why was it so difficult for her?

Many things are like that—seemingly simple, but actually quite challenging.

Haggling requires mental fortitude. To haggle effectively, one shouldn't be too attached to the item. This conveys an air of nonchalance.  A shrewd merchant can tell whether you really want the item or not, and will adjust their response accordingly.

Su Yuqing’s first haggling attempt ended in failure.  But failure is the mother of success. With more practice, she would eventually master this skill.

Women tend to be better at haggling. They are more patient and express their emotions more clearly and intensely.

Most men are not good at haggling, likely due to their more rational thinking styles.

So, was Su Yuqing’s thinking style rational or emotional?

Currently, it leaned more towards emotional, but the full development of her thinking style would depend on future experiences.

Perhaps one day Su Yuqing would have an epiphany, become more rational, and abandon her seemingly impossible dream of becoming a girl.

After buying the comforter, thirty yuan remained from the hundred. Su Yuqing went to a nearby convenience store to buy essential toiletries: a toothbrush, toothpaste, a mug, a washbasin, a towel, and a foam floor mat—all the cheapest options. Even so, only five yuan remained after the purchase.

Money always disappears so quickly. Su Yuqing touched the five yuan in her pocket, feeling a sense of wistfulness.

That's why so many people chase after money, even committing immoral or inhumane acts.

Back in her tiny apartment, Su Yuqing was busy again.

She placed the washbasin and other toiletries on a five-yuan stool.  She didn’t put them in the bathroom because it was too small. Adding these items would make the cramped space even tighter; turning around would be difficult.

Su Yuqing laid the cheap foam mat on the floor.  Though the paint was shoddy, she felt satisfied once it was completely down.

The matted area became her “bedroom.”  Slippers were required to enter the “bedroom.”  Su Yuqing could walk barefoot on the soft, warm mat, or even roll around on it. In a way, this expanded the usable space of the small room.

When she finished, it was getting late. Su Yuqing set her alarm clock, setting the ring time.

The boss said work started at six a.m.  Although the noodle shop was nearby, it was her first day; being late would create a bad impression.  Su Yuqing set the alarm for 5:20 a.m., giving her ample time—a full forty minutes.

The bathroom lacked a modern water heater, common even then. The water was icy cold, even colder than the outside temperature.

She didn't have much money left. Buying a thermos or electric kettle would deplete her remaining funds.  She needed to keep some money for emergencies, especially living alone.  Lack of money meant a lack of security.  So, despite the cold water, Su Yuqing endured it without buying a thermos or kettle.

“Oof…” Su Yuqing shivered after washing her feet in the ice water.  Trembling, she went to bed, pulled up the new chocolate and white checkered comforter, snuggled into it, curling up on the small bed like a cold cat.

Su Yuqing hadn’t slept well the previous night, and had been tired all day.  Although it was only 8 p.m., she was already sleepy.  She switched off the bedside lamp and fell asleep instantly.

Some say that if a person is very tired during the day, they won't dream at night because their brains are too exhausted to think.

Dreamless sleep is the most comfortable. Some people even feel more tired in the morning after dreaming.

Su Yuqing had a dreamless sleep all night, waking only to the chirping of birds.

It wasn't birds, but her alarm clock.

Su Yuqing gently switched off the alarm, staring into the dark room.

The sun was just rising above the horizon, casting a faint light.

Su Yuqing stared at the dark ceiling for a while, before realizing the faint sunlight on the ceiling.

“Um… it's morning already…” Su Yuqing rubbed her temples. She wanted to sleep a little longer, but the alarm clock pointed to twenty past five.  She had to get up or she'd be late.

Even though it was early spring, getting up wasn't much easier than in winter. Su Yuqing mustered her courage to throw off the covers, as if afraid of changing her mind, jumped out of bed, stretched on the soft foam mat, and put on her clothes.

The icy wash water was a good thing—it woke her up instantly.

The bathroom was small, but the landlord had installed a mirror. Su Yuqing stared at herself while washing, checking her reflection in any reflective surface, worried about her appearance or unkempt hair.

That's a habit of girls, isn't it?

She didn't have much hair to style, but she habitually combed her short hair with a cute little wooden comb. The feeling of the comb on her scalp was comfortable, not much different from a cold shower after sweating profusely.

“Ugh… a pimple…” Su Yuqing lightly touched a small pimple on her forehead, unsure whether to pop it or leave it alone.  She had never had a pimple before.

“Forget it… leave it be…” Su Yuqing pulled her baseball cap down slightly to cover the small pimple, looked at herself in the mirror, and nodded in satisfaction.

After confirming her appearance in the mirror, Su Yuqing put on her hat and went out.

She was still wearing boys' clothes.  The small size made them look like they were designed for women.

Away from her parents, living alone in the small city, sleeping alone for the first time, Su Yuqing found it strange that she had slept so well the previous night. She was a picky sleeper and often couldn't sleep well in unfamiliar places, especially alone…

“Maybe because I was too tired yesterday…” Su Yuqing pressed down on the brim of her hat, walking close to the walls, feeling the slightly cool wind carrying the scent of grass, and arrived in front of the noodle shop.

Su Yuqing looked up at the shop sign. If she was going to work hard, she couldn’t even not know the name of the shop, right?

“Unnamed Noodle Shop…”

It was probably the result of the owner's inability to think of a name…

“Such a casual name…” Su Yuqing muttered, walking into the recently opened noodle shop.

…
