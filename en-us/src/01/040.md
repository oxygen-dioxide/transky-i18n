# 40 · Shipping Container Home

Yes, it's a large shipping container.  Though painted a different color than most, a closer look reveals its true nature.

The container's exterior is coated in a special paint with a subtle wood grain texture. From a distance, it looks like a small cabin, but up close, the metal sheeting is obvious.

"Ta-da!" Zhang Sifan stopped his electric scooter, turning to Su Yuqing. "We're here! This is my place!"

"It's really nice…" Su Yuqing dismounted, a little envious.  Though a container, it wasn't small, and standing alone in the grassy field gave it a secluded feel.

It was a bit like an old manor, in a way.

Zhang Sifan chuckled with satisfaction, parking the scooter under a small awning in front of the container.

The container was rectangular. On the far left was a large sliding door made of transparent glass, flanked by two clean floor-to-ceiling windows, allowing ample light into the interior.

This wasn't the entrance, however; this section served as a balcony.

The container was raised on a special frame, not sitting directly on the ground.  The small balcony hung in the air, supported by struts below.

The actual entrance was a small door on the far right.  Inside was a short hallway.  To the right was a bathroom; to the left, a large wardrobe. Further in was the bedroom: a refrigerator next to the wardrobe, a desk with a bookshelf, a comfortable bed, a sofa in the left corner, and in the right corner, next to the bed, a small wooden coffee table and two soft cushions—the kind used for kneeling in Japan or Korea.

Beyond that was the large floor-to-ceiling window and the transparent sliding door leading to the balcony, which overlooked a spacious expanse.

The abundant use of glass made the room feel exceptionally airy. Although only a little over twenty square meters, it didn't feel cramped at all.

"It's amazing…" Su Yuqing gazed out from the balcony at a small lake in the distance, its clear water shimmering under the sun.

"Heh heh, isn't it great?" Zhang Sifan was immensely proud. He usually had no one to show it off to; he didn't readily share his address with just anyone.

"It must be so nice to live here…" Su Yuqing closed her eyes, seeming to savor the fresh air.  "But the rent must be expensive?"

"No rent," Zhang Sifan smiled. "The container cost a thousand, plus simple renovations and furniture, maybe a little over five thousand.  About six or seven thousand total. In the city, a similarly sized apartment, even a basic one, would cost at least three or four hundred a month. Even three hundred a month adds up to three thousand a year, so I think this is more economical."

"But… the land?  The land must cost something."

"Well… the land isn't expensive. I only rented an acre. For the local farmers, an acre isn't much, so the rent is low—only two hundred."

"A month?"

"A year."

"Wow… amazing!" Su Yuqing was incredibly impressed.  "I wish I had a place like this."

"How about you move in with me?"

"Huh? Live with you? But my work… it's too far."

"That's true. Everything here is great, except for the distance from the city. My university is on the edge of town, and it takes me an hour to get there each time."

"Well… nothing's perfect, right?"

"Ugh… I’m all sticky and uncomfortable. I'm going to take a shower.  Want to join me, Xiaqing?"

"Huh? Me?"

"Yeah, shower together!" Zhang Sifan winked mischievously.

"I don't have any spare clothes…"

"It's okay, I have some."

"You go first… I'll shower later…"

"Let's shower together, together!" Zhang Sifan, without a second thought, pulled Su Yuqing into the bathroom.  While there was no bathtub, there was a glass-enclosed shower, like a cubicle, except this one had a window…

The window was made of special glass; you could see out from inside, but not in from outside.

"Xiaqing~ Come on, take your clothes off~ If you don't, I'll do it for you~"

"Eh, eh?" Su Yuqing, blushing crimson, shrank into a corner, nervously fending off Zhang Sifan's "grabby hands."

The scene was like a handsome man about to… you know… a young boy…

Su Yuqing's baseball cap was on the outside; her flat hair made her look more masculine.

So, a boy, not a girl.

It felt strangely like watching a… not-safe-for-work manga…

In a panic, Su Yuqing turned on the tap.  The cold water drenched her, sending a shiver down her spine…

Now her clothes were completely soaked.  She had to change.

"Is it cold?" Zhang Sifan asked concernedly.

"Uh… a little…" Su Yuqing hugged herself, trembling slightly.

"This water heater is slow. Even when it’s hot, it runs out quickly. It's secondhand, after all…" Zhang Sifan tossed his shirt into a laundry basket. "Xiaqing, you should take your clothes off; otherwise, you'll get colder."

"Mm…" Su Yuqing shyly turned away, slowly removing her clothes.  Zhang Sifan, seeing Su Yuqing's smooth back and slender legs, couldn't resist reaching out and gently touching her.

"Yaaah—" Su Yuqing trembled like a cute kitten. She turned, her face flushed.  "Hey… don't touch me…"

"Hmm, so Xiaqing is sensitive, huh?" Zhang Sifan grinned slyly.

Actually, Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan were both the same gender, the same kind of person.  Showering together wasn't inherently embarrassing, but Su Yuqing had never been to a public bathhouse, not even during military training, and sharing a shower with Zhang Sifan made her incredibly self-conscious.

Su Yuqing tried to look Zhang Sifan in the eyes, but found the other person also seemed to be avoiding eye contact, their pretty face slightly flushed.

"Ahem!" Zhang Sifan coughed loudly to hide his embarrassment.

"Sisi-jie is shy too," Su Yuqing saw that Zhang Sifan was just as embarrassed as she was, and the awkwardness lessened.  It was like… if one person ran naked down the street, they’d be embarrassed, but if two people ran naked together, it would be less so…

The same principle applied here?

It wasn't a complete transformation, but the awkwardness diminished.

If Zhang Sifan was slender, Su Yuqing was delicate.  Small and curled up, she looked like a kitten.

And more importantly…

"Hey? Xiaqing, you don't have any body hair?"

"Uh!?"

"Did you shave it off, like me? But you shouldn't have shaved…"

"Eh, eh? Mine… well… I was… born… without it…" Su Yuqing, covering her lower body, blushed, fidgeting.

"Wow! No way! Amazing! Is this… a white tiger?" Zhang Sifan once again showed his… questionable side; the shy person from before seemed to have vanished. "Let me touch it~"

"Eh, eh, eh!?" Su Yuqing was startled and fled, only to slip and fall right into Zhang Sifan's arms.

"Oof!" Su Yuqing felt a slender hand grasp… well, *that*.

"Uh… ahem!" Zhang Sifan realized he'd gone too far. He quickly let go of Su Yuqing, turning his back. "Okay, okay, I'm not teasing you anymore. Let's shower…"

"Mm…" Su Yuqing, using her soft legs to support herself, picked up the showerhead, filled a basin with water, and quietly washed herself.

After that, they tacitly kept their backs to each other.  Zhang Sifan didn’t make any more inappropriate gestures, though he still teased her with suggestive comments.

"Xiaqing hasn't developed yet, right?"

"Um… I think… it's starting…"

"Hmm, I wonder if you'll grow hair…"

"Hey…"

"I didn't mean it like that.  Hair is a hassle, especially leg hair.  Laser hair removal isn't permanent; it grows back.  Depilatory creams are bad for your skin and not smooth enough…"

"You're right. I don't want hair either… though… down there… it's…"

"Isn't it great?" Zhang Sifan laughed. "Lots of people envy that. You probably won’t grow any if you keep taking your medicine."

"Mm."

Both were meticulous, so they took their time showering, using basin after basin of water before finishing.

As soon as they finished, Zhang Sifan eagerly pulled Su Yuqing to the bedroom—

"Eh, eh? We're both naked…" Su Yuqing looked at the bedroom's transparent floor-to-ceiling window and sliding door, nervously whispering.
