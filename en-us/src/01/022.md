# 22 Forget-Me-Nots

“Hmm…” Su Yuqing looked at the wide variety of flowers, feeling a little dazzled. Perhaps red roses, or pure, pink lilies?

Finally, Su Yuqing’s gaze settled on a small, light blue flower. It wasn’t striking, but it held a unique beauty.

Su Yuqing didn’t know much about flowers, only recognizing a few common ones.

Seeing Su Yuqing looking at a particular flower, though she hadn’t spoken, the shopkeeper, while wrapping flowers for another customer, began to describe it.

“That’s a forget-me-not, a small blue flower. Very pretty. It symbolizes never forgetting your original intention. Combined with baby’s breath, it makes a lovely bouquet.”

“Hmm… how much is one?” Su Yuqing asked timidly.

“One yuan.”

“I… I’ll take one…”

It was just a one-yuan sale, and the shopkeeper was quite busy. He casually said, “Just pick one yourself.”

So Su Yuqing chose a forget-me-not with the palest color. While the other forget-me-nots were light blue, their color was still quite distinct. This one, however, was so pale it was almost white, looking underdeveloped.

Su Yuqing carefully held the forget-me-not, placed a one-yuan coin on the shopkeeper’s table, and left contentedly.

The uncomfortable stares that had been following her disappeared as she walked into the dimly lit alley.

This forget-me-not wasn’t for anyone else; it was a flower Su Yuqing bought for herself.

This exceptionally pale forget-me-not looked especially fragile, its petals thin like paper, yet it held a unique charm that had captivated Su Yuqing.

Hearing its name only increased her fondness, leading her to buy it without hesitation.

Forget-me-nots, originally meant to remind lovers not to forget their initial love, held a different meaning for Su Yuqing.

Never forget your original aspirations, don’t let the harshness of reality extinguish them…

“Hmm~ hmm hmm hmm~” Su Yuqing, in an unusually good mood, hummed a little tune, a melody of her own creation. Her soft voice, when she sang it, could stir something deep within the listener, as if touching the deepest part of their heart.

Su Yuqing hadn’t eaten all day and was naturally hungry. She bought a large steamed bun from a nearby store and returned home.

A large steamed bun cost only fifty cents, but they were quite substantial. For Su Yuqing, with her small appetite, one was enough. As for snacks, she had dried tofu and hawthorn slices… plenty to tide her over.

It was best to save money whenever possible—although Su Yuqing sometimes couldn't resist buying things that seemed unnecessary.

Su Yuqing found a discarded aluminum can on the roadside.  Back home, she washed it, filled it with water, and placed the pale blue forget-me-not inside.

The can with the forget-me-not sat on the windowsill.

Perhaps because the room was small, Su Yuqing could distinctly smell a faint floral fragrance spreading. Maybe she should buy flowers for the house occasionally. Each deep breath would bring the delicate scent, lifting even the most somber mood.

Having slept almost all day on the soft grass by the riverbank, Su Yuqing felt no fatigue, only invigorated. With nothing to do, she opened the Barbie doll she'd bought the previous night.

Honestly, the Barbie doll's craftsmanship was subpar, even for authentic ones.  It was a mass-produced item after all; one couldn't expect too much.  Su Yuqing had always wanted a BJD doll, but previously, her parents had restricted her. Now, though there were no restrictions, the problem was even simpler—she had no money.

A BJD doll cost at least 500 yuan, excluding any accessories. Then there were various subtypes. Compared to that, a Barbie doll was much simpler.

The box was large, and the contents were plentiful: a miniature vanity, toilet, stove…

and various tiny combs, mirrors, etc. Though the Barbie doll’s craftsmanship was poor, the accessories were quite complete.

And the Barbie dolls were designed in the image of white and Black people…

Su Yuqing couldn't quite appreciate the foreign aesthetic, but it didn’t diminish her love for the toy. After all, the main fun of Barbie dolls was changing clothes…

And the outfits provided weren't nearly enough. The greatest pleasure was in making her own.  Su Yuqing had some skill in this area. She could tear off a piece of paper and make a skirt or top. However, using plain white paper made them look odd.  Special colored paper would be better.

Su Yuqing played with the Barbie, eventually dressing it in her paper creations. They looked quite amusing…

Besides the Barbie doll itself, the included small toys were also fun. Su Yuqing made small paper boxes and displayed the toys inside, giving it a playhouse feel.

Su Yuqing was also adept at playing house alone. She could simultaneously play the roles of mother, father, son, and daughter, never finding it boring but rather more enjoyable.

It was simply a process of storytelling.

Only Su Yuqing’s stories were casual, sometimes childish. Now, more than ever, they were stories of the beautiful future she yearned for…

The sun finally set, and the dark night once again ruled the small city.

Su Yuqing, though a child, was already quite grown up. Playing with toys was more of a habit, or perhaps a form of remembrance, and a little bit of whimsy.  She couldn't play for long before she felt bored.

Though she was alone in the room, the thought of playing with such childish toys for so long made Su Yuqing blush, making her regret buying the toy set.

Why had she impulsively bought it? She shouldn't do that again; that much money could buy her several necessities…

“Well… consider it a lesson…” Su Yuqing muttered, putting away the toys.

Maturity accumulated in these small things.

The steamed bun was cold, but it didn’t affect the taste; it felt chewier.

As she ate, she read Lu Xun’s essays, thinking that when she had money, she should buy books to pass the time…

Hangzhou had libraries where one could borrow books. Su Yuqing didn't know if this small city did; probably not. In a city of indeterminate tier, even if there were a library, it likely wouldn’t have the books Su Yuqing wanted…

Another holiday ended. Su Yuqing took her medicine on time and went to bed early.

Even if she didn't sleep, there was nothing to do.

But having slept so long during the day, Su Yuqing wasn’t sleepy at night. She stared at the shadows projected on the ceiling, imagining various shapes.

“Meow…” a soft, familiar meow came from outside the window. A completely black cat blended into the night, gazing at Su Yuqing through the window, who was trying to fall asleep with her eyes closed.

The black cat probably wanted to squeeze through the crack in the window, but Su Yuqing had only left a small gap. Even for a cat's flexible body, it wouldn’t be easy, unless it could somehow open the window.

The black cat didn’t try. It turned away, sprang lightly onto the ground, its body neatly landing on a sneaky, fat rat’s tail.

The large, fat rat squeaked in fear, both pleading and resisting.

But as the rat’s natural predator, the black cat was unafraid.

With surprising swiftness, it bit the rat’s neck, but didn't kill it. The rat was still alive, but weak, its instinct to survive causing it to struggle.

The black cat “cruelly” toyed with the rat until it died, then contentedly nudged the lifeless body, bit its neck, and silently walked into the darkness to enjoy its late-night snack.

Su Yuqing dreamt again. It wasn't the creepy park or a frightening nightmare. She dreamt of a sea of flowers, a sea of forget-me-nots.

Pale blue forget-me-nots bloomed everywhere, filling the air with a rich fragrance with each breath.

Standing on a hillside, gazing at the forget-me-nots covering the mountains, Su Yuqing felt intoxicated.

It was perhaps the most pleasant dream she'd had in days.

Su Yuqing walked into the sea of flowers, feeling the natural scent.

A white forget-me-not, unlike the other pale blue ones, caught her attention.

It was pure white, without a trace of blue, and strangely shaped. Its petals were larger than the others, somewhat like a lily but more like a forget-me-not.

This flower didn’t bloom as vigorously as the others, its head drooping, seeming weak and unable to draw nutrients from the soil.

“Such a strange flower…”
