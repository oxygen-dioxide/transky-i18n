# 54 · Kong Temple

Su Yuqing walked along the spring path. Not far away was a wide, deserted road.  The path led to Kong Temple.

The path, though small, was relatively flat.  Many people had walked it these past few days, smoothing out any thorns or brambles.

Though trampled underfoot, some even pressed deep into the soil, the thorns displayed an incredible tenacity.  One flower had even bloomed from a branch buried in the earth, adorning the ordinary dirt path.

Cookie and Coffee followed closely behind, seemingly familiar with the route.  They’d occasionally dart into the nearby grass, disappearing only to reappear moments later, having taken some shortcut, ahead of Su Yuqing.

Su Yuqing’s small hands were tucked into her large shirt sleeves, only her five clean fingers visible.  A light sweat beaded on her forehead, her little face flushed, looking exceptionally cute.

“吱吱!” Coffee, whose silky fur was speckled with grass seeds from its explorations, looked both disheveled and comical.  Holding a wild berry in its paws, it quickly scampered onto Cookie’s back and began to eat.

Cookie glanced at Coffee, then bit off a wildflower from the side of the path, chewing it thoroughly before swallowing.

Cats eat flowers?

This was Su Yuqing’s first time witnessing this.  The cats she’d known before wouldn't even touch rice, let alone plants…

Compared to dogs, cats were notoriously picky eaters.

The winding path continued, turning this way and that, until the sound of voices became audible.

Though closer now, the sound still seemed to wind its way around several bends before reaching them, to the entrance of Kong Temple.

This was a small temple, rarely visited.  The outer walls were covered in vines, weeds sprouted from the cracks in the bluestone floor, and a lush ginkgo tree dominated the courtyard. Despite the lack of care, it thrived, almost completely shading the small front yard.

Groups of elderly people chatted, mostly about their grandchildren – their academic achievements or jobs, often boasting about their grandkids’ accomplishments…

Elderly people don’t have much entertainment, so showing off their grandchildren is one of their few pleasures, right?

Besides the chatter of the elderly, the temple was relatively quiet.  Su Yuqing slowly walked inside, feeling a wave of coolness.  A statue of Confucius stood within, surrounded by scattered straw mats.

The floor, made of cracked bluestone, looked ancient and weathered, far more authentic than the so-called "preserved historical sites" Su Yuqing had visited before.

Many of those "preserved sites" were actually modern reconstructions based on old blueprints – essentially, artificially aged imitations.

This ridiculous practice was uniquely Chinese – tearing down cultural relics that survived wars, only to rebuild them a decade later…

It felt like self-deception.

Su Yuqing looked down at Cookie, then lifted her head, bumping into a firm chest.

“I-I’m sorry…” Su Yuqing quickly apologized, stepping back.

“It’s alright.” The voice was gentle, yet the tone was surprisingly gruff.  Su Yuqing looked up to see a broad-shouldered, large-eared man standing before her. Though clean-shaven, a layer of bluish stubble suggested a full beard.

Su Yuqing looked at him curiously, sensing something special about him.  What was it…?

“Are you here to worship Confucius?” The man, easily six feet tall, asked.

“Um… I guess so.”  Su Yuqing, usually shy, didn’t stammer. It felt like chatting with a familiar person, though a little shy.

“But isn’t it Monday? Why aren’t you in school?” The man smiled gently, though the expression seemed oddly incongruous on his face…

His face seemed more suited to boisterous or fierce emotions. This gentle, almost sisterly smile felt strangely unsettling…

Then, Su Yuqing understood the earlier sense of familiarity.  It felt like… encountering a kindred spirit?

Kindred spirit!?  What a joke… a six-foot-tall, burly man couldn't possibly be her kindred spirit!

Su Yuqing found it hard to believe.  Perhaps he reminded her of her tall cousin, another burly man, but he was always gruff and never spoke so "gently"…

“Um…” Su Yuqing didn’t know how to respond, choosing to play dumb and stand there, unsure whether to continue inside or turn back.

Luckily, the man didn’t press further.  Seeing Su Yuqing’s hesitation, he softly said, “Be careful next time,” and walked out of the temple.

Su Yuqing felt a shiver down her spine, not a bit touched by the man’s “fierce tenderness”…

It was like Sylvester Stallone attempting a Korean drama heartthrob’s dialogue—utterly bizarre…

Su Yuqing wasn't actually there to worship Confucius; she had no need. Still, she paid her respects.

A hugely significant figure in ancient Chinese history, the great Confucius…

This temple was reportedly built by one of Confucius’ disciples after the master’s death, a tribute to their teacher.  The disciple’s name…

Wasn’t recorded here, probably an obscure follower.

“Um… I think I should worship Guan Yu…” Su Yuqing muttered to herself, making a joke.  “Guan Yu is the god of wealth, perfect for my broke self…”

Cookie looked up at Confucius' statue, seemingly in reverence.  But of course, it wasn’t reverence for a human ancestor.  It saw the tall statue as a uniquely designed cat tree.

Cookie quickly climbed to the top of Confucius' head, settling into a comfortable position and lazily lying down.

Su Yuqing twitched.  Climbing onto Confucius' head – that’s like tempting fate…

“Cookie, get down…” Su Yuqing whispered.

“Meow~” Cookie looked at Su Yuqing, showing no intention of moving.  Confucius’ head seemed quite comfy.

“Get down!” Su Yuqing had to stand on a nearby platform, tiptoeing to carefully lift Cookie down.  Luckily, it didn’t move, otherwise Su Yuqing might have fallen.

The tiptoeing wasn’t because the statue was tall, but because Su Yuqing was short…

There wasn't much to see in the temple. After getting Cookie down, Su Yuqing left, returning along the path.

She preferred the grassy riverbank to Kong Temple. Perhaps Su Yuqing was a natural water-lover.

To Su Yuqing’s surprise, the burly man hadn’t gone far. He stood in a field of azaleas, a vibrant cluster of flowers.

He gently reached out his thick arm, carefully picking a blossom, then leaned in to inhale its fragrance, seeming to savor the fresh scent.

The scene, however… was incredibly incongruous…

Su Yuqing was about to leave, only having met the man for a few minutes, no need for farewells…

But the man spotted her and beckoned her over.

“It’s the little girl!  Did you finish your worship?”

“Um…” Su Yuqing lowered her head, avoiding his gaze.

Being too gentle was a mistake. Or rather, everyone should have a gentleness that matched their image, otherwise it seemed weird.

“Wait for me.” The man said, picking several of the brightest azaleas, walking to Su Yuqing, and offering them to her.

“Uh…?” Su Yuqing looked at him questioningly, not taking the flowers.

“Remove the pistil, then taste it.” He spoke softly, but the sound resonated deeply in Su Yuqing’s ears…

“Um… thank you…” Su Yuqing accepted the azaleas, unsure.  “Is it… edible?”

“Of course.”

If he hadn't added that “ne” at the end, it would have been slightly more bearable…

Su Yuqing thought to herself, but she couldn’t refuse his kindness. He seemed harmless, just eccentric, but kind-hearted.

So Su Yuqing removed the pistils and put the petals in her mouth. They were slightly sweet and sour, light and delicate, stimulating her taste buds – fresh and natural.

Su Yuqing, a city girl, had never tasted such flower petals, even in the countryside. Even when she drank herbal tea with flowers, she only drank the tea, never the flowers…

“How is it?” the man smiled.

“Um… surprisingly good!” Su Yuqing nodded lightly, feeling a bit of affection for the eccentric man.  Actually, she hadn't disliked him from the start.

“Cookie meow, want some?” Su Yuqing offered an azalea to Cookie, who readily accepted.

Come to think of it, it had eaten those kinds of flowers earlier, right?
