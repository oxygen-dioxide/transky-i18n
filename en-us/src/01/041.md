# 41 · Shrine Maiden Outfit

The shrine maiden outfit is originally a traditional Chinese garment worn by female shamans during religious ceremonies.  It later spread to Japan, influencing Japanese culture, and underwent modifications there.  With the passage of time, various types of shrine maiden outfits have emerged, broadly classified into traditional and anime-style versions.

Traditional ones are naturally more conservative, while anime-style outfits are designed to be more striking, with shorter skirts…

Most Chinese people, however, are unaware of the ancient Chinese shrine maiden outfits used in ceremonies, only familiar with those from Japanese shrines.  This, it must be said, is a tragedy.

It's like some people can't distinguish between Hanfu and Kimono.

China's ancient culture has lost its continuity within China itself; in modern times, neighboring countries seem to be closer to what China once was…

The spacious bedroom usually provides ample light, but after a shower…

it feels like one is being exposed, even though it's surrounded by flat land and no one is outside…

“Ahem! Forget it… I usually draw the curtains… I was just too excited today…” Zhang Sifan, somewhat flustered, rushed to the window and pulled the thick curtains shut, instantly blocking most of the light. The brightly lit bedroom immediately darkened.

“So Sis SiSi gets shy too?”

“Little girl, teasing me, aren’t you?” Zhang Sifan made a “fierce” expression to mask her embarrassment, then eagerly rummaged through the closet.

“Sis SiSi, shouldn't you put on clothes first…?” Su Yuqing hugged herself, curled up, shivering slightly. Although it was midday, it was still spring; while the weather was warm, it wasn't hot, and standing without clothes would still feel cold.

“Um… Xiaoqing, go under the covers first… I'll find some clothes…”

“Mm…” Su Yuqing softly nodded, without hesitation, directly diving into the soft duvet—because she really felt unbearably cold.

Zhang Sifan’s duvet was better than Su Yuqing’s; it was much softer, like being nestled in her parents' arms as a child.

Su Yuqing’s own duvet took a long time to warm up, while Zhang Sifan's was warm almost immediately.  This warmth enveloped Su Yuqing, making her drowsy.

After all, the mountain climb had taken a toll; the half-day excursion left Su Yuqing tired, and this comfortable bed…

Sleepiness overcame her, and Su Yuqing curled up in the duvet, like a well-behaved kitten, falling into a dream.

But the sleep didn't last long, because Zhang Sifan woke her.

“Eh? Xiaoqing? Asleep?” Zhang Sifan gently nudged Su Yuqing, softly calling, “Hey hey? Sleeping now means you won't sleep tonight, wake up~”

“Mm… uh…?” Su Yuqing sleepily opened her eyes, yawning slightly, looking drowsy and weary.

Zhang Sifan had already dressed. She wore a somewhat gothic-style dress—a black top and a red short skirt. The sleeves clung to her arms; thankfully, Zhang Sifan no longer had muscle there, though her frame was a bit large, it was still slender enough to look fine.  Lace trim adorned the sleeves and collar, and she wore black stockings with a slight sheen, looking quite textured.

“Change clothes~” Zhang Sifan placed a neatly folded outfit in front of Su Yuqing, smiling, “A whole outfit, see if it fits!”

“Eh? Oh…” Su Yuqing was about to get out of the warm duvet, then suddenly remembered she was naked, blushing slightly as she said to Zhang Sifan, “That… Sis SiSi… can I… change… alone…?”

“Eh? We just showered together, what's to be shy about, I want to admire it too.”

“Mm…” Su Yuqing’s face reddened further. She lightly bit her lip, as if making a major decision.

“Alright alright, I'm just teasing you, I'll wait at the door, hurry up and change.”

“Mm!” Su Yuqing happily nodded vigorously.

Zhang Sifan was indeed well-prepared; she'd not only gotten a shrine maiden outfit but also underwear for Su Yuqing, pure white panties with a small pink bow, and a similarly styled pure white bra.

Zhang Sifan bought smaller sizes, tighter fits for herself, and though they weren't perfectly snug on Su Yuqing, they were close enough.

She bought them too small because of some issues with trying clothes on in fitting rooms; relying solely on size charts resulted in discrepancies.

Of course, that was just when she started; she later developed a system, and while she still occasionally bought too big or small, it wasn't as extreme as the ones she initially got for Su Yuqing.

After putting on her panties and bra, Su Yuqing picked up the shrine maiden outfit. The clothes were clean, smelling faintly of lavender. Su Yuqing carefully examined it, finding it wasn’t difficult to put on, or rather, it was a simplified version.

The top was a long-sleeved white shirt with pink accents, similar to a blouse but with some inexplicably decorative lace and pleats. The sleeves were quite wide, intentionally designed that way; one could make a “whoosh” sound by swinging them.  The skirt was mostly red, turning black at the hem.

Even socks were provided, not long socks but ordinary white ankle socks, without any decoration whatsoever, yet they didn't clash with the somewhat ornate outfit; instead, they felt perfectly harmonious.

Su Yuqing twirled in front of the mirror, very pleased with the outfit. The material was good, comfortable, light, and warm.

Except…

Su Yuqing looked at her extremely short buzz cut, frowning. While it had grown a little, it was still too short. While fine with men’s clothing, it felt terribly incongruous with the female outfit, mocking her.

“Xiaoqing, are you done?”

“Done…” Su Yuqing answered listlessly.

“What's wrong? Don't like it?” Zhang Sifan, seeing Su Yuqing's expression, asked curiously.

“No… I like it…” Su Yuqing pouted, looking at herself in the mirror, remaining silent.

Zhang Sifan quickly noticed the incongruity and laughed lightly, saying, “That’s nothing, easily solved!”

Saying so, Zhang Sifan pulled out a large box from under the bed.  Opening it revealed a box full of wigs, various styles and colors, at least twenty or so, making Su Yuqing stare.

“So many…” Su Yuqing said enviously.

She'd had wigs before, but her father had burned them all. After moving to the small city, she could barely make ends meet; buying wigs was definitely out of the question.

Even cheap ones would probably cost seventy or eighty yuan.

“Hmm… let me see… suitable for this outfit…” Zhang Sifan bit her finger, thinking for a while, then picked out a pure black wig, “Try this one?”

Su Yuqing’s movements were clumsy; although she had bought wigs, she hadn’t worn them much because she’d had few opportunities.

“Let me.” Zhang Sifan went behind Su Yuqing.

Su Yuqing obediently lowered her hands, letting Zhang Sifan handle the wig, gently placing it on her head.

It felt like a strange hat.

After putting on the wig, Zhang Sifan straightened it with a comb and tied a long ponytail with a hair tie.

Because the wig was long and soft, the ponytail didn’t stick up like most girls’, instead, it hung softly over Su Yuqing’s shoulders.

“…Done?”

“Done.” Zhang Sifan patted Su Yuqing’s shoulder, winking, “Perfect!”

Su Yuqing hesitantly looked up, gazing at her reflection…

“How is it, are you charmed by your own cuteness?”

“…” Su Yuqing touched her slightly red cheeks, longing for the person in the mirror. If only that wig were her own hair…

But it would take so long for her hair to grow that long…

Maybe ten years wouldn't be enough?

At this thought, Su Yuqing sighed softly; she’d be content if her hair could just reach her neck… but that would take at least a year, right?

“Don’t sigh, don’t like it?”

“I like it very much, I was just thinking, when will my own hair grow this long.”

“It will, don't be disheartened~” Zhang Sifan smiled, pinching Su Yuqing’s cheek, “My hair is about as short as yours, let’s work hard together~ see who grows faster~”

“Uh…?” Su Yuqing looked at Zhang Sifan, wanting to see how short her (femboys use *she* when referring to trans girls) hair was, but Zhang Sifan was wearing a wig, so Su Yuqing couldn't see.  “Sis SiSi, why did you shave your head?”

“Because I dyed my hair purple before… ahem, thought it looked nice at the time, then thought it was too emo… and my hair was dyed so many times, the quality wasn't good, so I just shaved it off, letting it grow back naturally.”
