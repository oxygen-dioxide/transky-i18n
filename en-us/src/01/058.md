# 58 Spring Dream

Spring is the season of rebirth, the season when animals—including humans—come into heat.

The reason… is probably because the temperature is comfortable, making it easier to trigger some wonderful fantasies.

In her sleep, Su Yuqing's mind was replaying the contents of the BL novel she had read today.  It started with lines of text, which naturally transformed into images.  From a series of still "photos," they became moving pictures, then sound was added. Finally, Su Yuqing felt as if she were immersed in it. If before there was still a sense of watching, now it felt as if she were the protagonist herself.

…

Around her, it was pitch black, not a ray of light penetrating. Even straining her eyes, Su Yuqing could see nothing.

Her body was immobile, her joints bound tightly with rope. Her hands were tied behind her back, her legs secured to the bed.

A cold wind blew from somewhere, making Su Yuqing shiver.

Then, a warm hand gently pressed against her thigh. Even in the darkness, Su Yuqing seemed to see him: a handsome and beautiful young man. He smiled faintly, spreading Su Yuqing's legs, one hand gently grasping the ever-growing white caterpillar…

"Mmm…" Su Yuqing let out a moan, feeling her bones melt. The delicate moan also filled her with embarrassment. She couldn't believe she had made such… such a sound.

The young man said nothing, simply pressing his body against Su Yuqing's back. With one hand, he toyed with the tender white caterpillar, while the other gently caressed two pink cherries.

The stimulating current surged through her, tingling and numbing, making her soul feel like it was about to leave her body. Yet, there was a feeling of unsatisfaction, as if she craved something more.

"Huff… huff…" Su Yuqing breathed softly, but suddenly realized that the hand holding the caterpillar was gone. Then, she felt something soft, like silicone, being stuffed into her mouth. A strap was tied to the back of her head, preventing the silicone sphere from falling out. Su Yuqing was unable to close her mouth properly…

Clear saliva dripped from her lips, stirring an indescribable feeling in her heart.

The caterpillar was gently peeled open, causing a slight pain. Then, she felt herself enveloped by something warm. A soft, flexible thing moved continuously on the caterpillar.

So uncomfortable… it felt like… not enough…

It was like a delicious dish placed before you, but you couldn't reach it. The discomfort was almost maddening…

However, this feeling didn't last long.  Su Yuqing soon felt something hard pressing against her behind, then slowly entering her…

She felt no pain, no comfort, nothing at all, only endless emptiness…

"So uncomfortable… hmm…" Su Yuqing opened her eyes.

A ray of morning light streamed into the room. The rising sun was still tender, but Su Yuqing had already kicked the covers to the floor sometime during the night. The sheets were in disarray, her loose shirt was rumpled, revealing most of her navel…

Su Yuqing felt a tightness in her chest, as if something was pent up inside, unable to escape.

"So sad…" she muttered to herself, sitting up in bed. She felt something damp, already dry, sticking uncomfortably to her lower body.

She looked down and found her men's boxer shorts half-pulled down, the small caterpillar curled inside, traces of milky white fluid remaining…

"Ah!" Su Yuqing instinctively covered her face, her face flushing crimson. She understood the situation perfectly.  Considering the dream she had last night…

It was a spring dream, and then… nocturnal emission…

The caterpillar was still sensitive; even a gentle tug on the boxers sent a tingling electric current through her.

Thankfully, the sheets were clean.  Su Yuqing just needed to shower and change clothes…

Thinking of the dream she had last night, Su Yuqing felt so embarrassed she wanted to disappear into the earth. She never imagined she would have such an explicit dream… and it was so… kinky…

Was it influenced by that BL novel…?

Whatever, she should take a shower first…

Whether it was due to the embarrassing dream last night, or the early morning wake-up, or the refreshing shower; or perhaps a combination of all three, Su Yuqing felt exceptionally refreshed and energetic today. It was like she was back to when her body was in good condition – she could run a thousand meters without getting tired.

Of course, it was just a feeling, perhaps an illusion… Su Yuqing wouldn't try it. She was much more afraid of being tired now.

Illusion or reality, Su Yuqing's steps were lighter than in the past few days, like a fluttering butterfly, not raising a speck of dust…

She didn't see Cookie along the way, probably with its "boyfriend," enjoying their time together. Come to think of it, before going to bed last night, she seemed to have heard a few meows of a cat in heat. Was it Cookie?

"Auntie Zhang, Uncle Li~ Good morning!" Su Yuqing greeted them proactively upon entering the shop.

"Little Qing looks particularly energetic today!" Auntie Zhang smiled.

This was the first time Su Yuqing had taken the initiative to greet them; it was always Auntie Zhang who greeted her first.

"Well…Ahem… I probably slept very well." Su Yuqing's face visibly reddened as she said "well".

"Oh? Little Qing's here so early? It's not even eight yet, right?"  Boss Li was busy scooping a bowl of mixed noodles.

"Yeah, I was up anyway, and I had nothing else to do, so I came to work early."

"Then you probably won't have breakfast."

"I'll help," Su Yuqing nodded lightly. In fact, she hadn't been up long and wasn't very hungry.

It was the morning peak, and the shop was full of customers. Many were taking food to go, and Su Yuqing's job was twofold: packaging food for customers and handling cash.

Although she hadn't made breakfast in a long time, Su Yuqing was still very efficient. With Su Yuqing's help, Auntie Zhang and Boss Li were immediately less stressed and no longer seemed so rushed.

"Boss, is this your new helper? The little girl is pretty, but she doesn't look of age, does she?" A regular morning customer who hadn't seen Su Yuqing before asked.

"Haha, our Little Qing is a boy," Boss Li laughed.

"No way? Old Li, don't lie to me.  That doesn't look like a boy at all."

"Well, how to put it? He's like a pretty boy? Don't Korean dramas have these types?" Auntie Zhang handed a bowl of wontons to the customer.

"Hey, the young people's world… never mind, we're old!"

"Old? It's you who can't keep up with the times." Auntie Zhang chuckled. It was clear that she kept up with trends, knowing about current pop culture.

"Yeah, unlike you, you're like an 18-year-old girl, so quick to embrace new things." The customer joked.

"Eighteen? I'm an old woman already."  Though she said that, Auntie Zhang looked clearly delighted. Which woman wouldn't want to be complimented on her youth?

"A bowl of small wontons, to go."

"Okay." Su Yuqing nodded, took twenty pre-made wontons from the freezer with a netted ladle, placed them in a large iron pot of boiling water. Then she sprinkled seaweed, shrimp chips, and salt on a paper bowl. After cooking the wontons, she put them in the bowl and added boiling water as wonton soup.  A steaming bowl of wontons was ready.

Su Yuqing efficiently packed the wontons and handed them to the customer, taking two one-yuan coins and putting them into the small metal cash box.

The wind gently lifted Su Yuqing's hair, causing a slight itch. She instinctively touched her hair.

They say that women are most sexy and beautiful when they touch their hair. Su Yuqing's action attracted the attention of many, especially the young middle school students.  Their eyes sparkled; they probably saw Su Yuqing as their dream lover…

"Another bowl of wontons!" A seemingly young middle school student suddenly shouted, deliberately glancing at Su Yuqing a few more times.

Su Yuqing probably couldn't understand his implied meaning. She only knew that someone wanted wontons, so she made them.  That's work.

That's all…

Several other middle and high school students followed suit, increasing the restaurant's popularity in a way…

After making a bowl of wontons, Su Yuqing carefully placed it in front of a middle school student, who avoided her gaze, staring intently at her delicate hand.

He subconsciously took a deep breath, as if to memorize the faint scent on Su Yuqing's body.

"So cute… cuter than the girls in our class…" his companion commented.

"She has a faint milky scent… so nice."

"Damn, I think I'm in love with her."

"Should we ask for her contact info?"

"Forget it… what if she doesn't have a phone… and… how awkward…"
