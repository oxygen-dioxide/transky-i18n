# 45 · A Month

A month.  Not long, not short, but long enough for a person to adapt to a new life.

Su Yuqing had been taking progynova and spironolactone for a full month. She'd experienced chest tightness and dizziness several times, but these symptoms gradually subsided.

The initial discomfort stemmed from the imbalance of hormones; now, it seemed the male hormones were completely suppressed.

There were still some effects, but nothing unbearable…

In just a month, Su Yuqing's hair had grown considerably, now covering half her ear.  It made her look even more like a tomboy.

Last night, Su Yuqing skipped her medication.  Yue Cheng—Zhang Sifan—had told her to take a break every month, for no more than a week, ideally two or three days.

Apparently, these medications put a heavy strain on the heart. Continuous use would worsen the burden, weakening the body.  Monthly breaks eased the stress. While the effect of a single break wasn't significant, long-term breaks slowed the deterioration.

For instance, instead of becoming severely weakened in a year, it might take three.

Everyone has both estrogen and testosterone, but men and women have different organs that continuously produce them, suppressing the opposite hormone to maintain their sex characteristics. External intervention disrupts this balance, allowing males to appear more feminine and vice-versa.

This only changes outward appearance. The primary sex characteristics remain unchanged, alterable only through bottom surgery…

Interfering with the natural growth process damages organs—the heart, kidneys, liver—and long-term use can cause sterility.  For men, this means reduced sperm motility, or even testicular atrophy…

A month of medication had created a hormonal inertia. A short break wouldn't have much impact.  But if prolonged, the rebounding testosterone would cause dizziness, nausea, chest tightness… general discomfort.

After a month, Su Yuqing, while occasionally lonely, was more cheerful than when she first arrived in the small city.  She still wondered about the future, but didn't dwell on it as much.  She'd take things one step at a time.

Perhaps it was a fatalistic attitude, or shortsightedness. But sometimes, foresight isn't beneficial. The further you see, the more you worry, often about insurmountable problems.

…

Her dreams were chaotic and hazy. Since the giant meteorite destroyed the park in her dreams, it had never reappeared.

Su Yuqing sat wearily in the void. Even in her dreams, she felt sleepy.  It wasn't a pitch-black void; there was movement, but she couldn't make it out.  It was like an 800-degree myope without glasses—a white blur, barely discerning shapes; further objects were just sizes.

The indistinct world didn't interest her, only increasing her drowsiness.  Over the month, she'd become increasingly sleepy, going to bed at 10 pm and struggling to get up at 8 am, forcing herself each morning. Otherwise, she'd be constantly late for work.

Everyone reacts differently to the medication. Some have insomnia, some are perpetually tired, some are sleepless at night and sleepy during the day…

Su Yuqing simply slept too much.

"Whoosh… whoosh…" The wind rattled the windows.  Rain hammered against the glass and the ground, a deafening roar.

It was a violent storm.

Occasionally, a deafening clap of thunder amplified the already intense downpour.

Besides the wind, rain, and thunder, there were no other sounds.

It was Sunday. Su Yuqing could sleep in, but she woke up around 8 am, a habit, and also because… her alarm went off.

A regular alarm can't be programmed to skip days; it rings unless it's dead or broken.

"Mmm… uh…" Su Yuqing weakly opened her eyes. The alarm seemed distant, muffled, so she didn't rush to turn it off. She just lay in bed, her mind blank.

She wanted to sleep but couldn't. While she was sleepy and didn't suffer from insomnia like some trans girls, waking up made it impossible to fall back asleep.  Something was interfering.

What did Su Yuqing think about each morning? Breakfast, perhaps? An interesting event?

Nothing.

It was a state of Zen-like emptiness. Not forgetfulness, but a lack of anything to think about. Her mind was empty, like a newborn's.

After a while, Su Yuqing came to.  Each morning, she felt like her soul had left her body, returning only after a few minutes.

"It's… morning…"  Su Yuqing rubbed her eyes, looking at the still-ringing alarm.

"Click."  She switched it off.  She felt weak, couldn't bring herself to get up, and decided to stay in bed.

Su Yuqing glanced at the clock, momentarily disoriented.  She couldn't read the numbers, but only for a second; the next moment, she could again.

Strange.  It was like it wasn't her.

Forgetting the time was normal. Sometimes, she'd wake up not knowing where she was, or even who she was…

It would take five or six minutes for her consciousness to return fully.

"Meow—"  A faint meow came from outside, barely audible through the storm.

The meow jolted Su Yuqing awake, though her head was still foggy. She looked out the window and saw a sopping wet black cat at her window, looking at her expectantly.

"Mm… Cookie?" Su Yuqing struggled out of bed, feeling weak.  Opening the window latch, normally effortless, took three or four minutes.

"Meow." Cookie shook itself and walked in, heading for Su Yuqing's desk.

Clean desk, now with black paw prints.

Maybe the heavy rain had driven Cookie here for shelter.

Su Yuqing didn't mind.  She had the day off and Cookie's company would keep her from being too bored.

"Squeak." As Su Yuqing reached for Cookie's wet fur, a rat emerged from behind the cat—the one with silky fur, clean and almost cute.

"Huh?"  Su Yuqing was surprised. Had Cookie caught another mouse?

But the rat wasn't scared; it was… friendly?

A cat and a mouse being friends?

Su Yuqing had only seen that online.  To see it in person…

"Squeak squeak squeak—" The grey mouse scampered to Su Yuqing, its black eyes curious.

Despite its cleanliness, Su Yuqing leaned back. What if it acted like Cookie, crawling all over her…

She couldn't handle that.  Even if it were clean, it was still a rat!

"Meow." Cookie stepped forward, grabbing the grey mouse by the scruff of its neck, placing it on its back like a mother cat with a kitten…

Even though Cookie was female, it was a rat…

"Cookie, you're soaked. Want a bath?" Su Yuqing asked.

Cookie stared at her with bright blue eyes, clearly not understanding.

"Okay, I'll bathe you~" Su Yuqing scooped up Cookie and headed for the bathroom. Cookie patted her arm with its tail, offering no resistance, purring and twitching its ears, submitting.
