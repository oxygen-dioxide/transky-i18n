# 56 · Zhang Sifan and Sun Hao's Sweet Nothings

“Okay, okay…Sis Si, stop it…” Su Yuqing blushed, pushing Zhang Sifan aside.  “So, he’s officially your boyfriend now?”

“Mmm… I guess so…”

“What did he say?” Su Yuqing asked, full of curiosity.

“Huh? I didn’t expect such a seemingly innocent little girl like you to be so gossipy,” Zhang Sifan teased, glancing at Su Yuqing sideways.

“Ahem! I wanna know, I wanna know~” Su Yuqing grabbed Zhang Sifan’s clothes and started acting coquettish.

This was actually the first time Su Yuqing had acted coquettish with anyone since growing up.  Even with her parents, she hadn't been this affectionate.  Having a girl's heart in a boy's body made it difficult to express herself fully. Today, she finally revealed her inner self, influenced by Zhang Sifan.

Zhang Sifan found it hard to resist Su Yuqing’s coquettishness; her pouting was too cute.

“Well… he said he likes me, no matter what… and that he wants to marry me.”

“Huh?” For a trans girl, this sounded incredibly romantic. But Su Yuqing wasn't naive.  She knew same-sex marriage wasn’t legal in China. Even after surgery, they would face parental opposition.  Ninety-nine percent of families wouldn't accept such a marriage…

Even if Sun Hao agreed, it would be difficult…

Family pressure, friends' pressure…

Zhang Sifan had been shouldering this burden alone. If Sun Hao decided to marry her, they would share it, making it even heavier.

“Is he serious?”

“I… don’t know…” Zhang Sifan pulled up a blade of grass, chewed it, and chuckled bitterly. “I’m conflicted. I hope he’s serious, but I also hope he’s joking…”

“You don't want to pressure him, but you hope he's sincere?”

“Something like that…”

“Mmm…” Su Yuqing fell silent.  She understood a lot, but she was still a child. Even if she understood these issues, she couldn't think of solutions. Most people couldn’t, either.

“It seems like you’ll have to emigrate,” Su Yuqing offered, the only solution she could think of.

“Yeah, he said that too. He said he’d make money and take me abroad…”

“If that’s the case, he’s a man you can rely on.”

“Mmm… sigh…”

“Sis Si, why the sigh?”

“It feels… unreal… Like a dream. Or maybe, he wasn’t being sincere.”

“Well… don’t think too much. Time will tell. You’re not in a rush anyway…”

“Right… forget it… I won’t think about it anymore.” Sis Si smiled, revealing her longing for the future.

Zhang Sifan had found her future partner.  What about Su Yuqing?

Though much younger, she couldn’t help but think about these things. Being alone was lonely. Having someone who loved her would be nice.

Su Yuqing wasn’t firmly set on men or women. Deep down, she believed she would accept anyone who genuinely loved her.

Of course, whether that was true remained to be seen.

As they fell silent, lost in thought, Zhang Sifan’s phone rang.  She glanced at the caller ID and smiled sweetly.

Probably Sun Hao.

Su Yuqing was right.  It was Sun Hao.  A boyfriend calling his girlfriend was normal. It seemed Sun Hao genuinely wanted to be with Zhang Sifan.

Su Yuqing no longer found Sun Hao so unpleasant.  Perhaps he just seemed unreliable.

Su Yuqing cautioned herself again: judging by appearances was wrong…

“Hello? Haohao~”

“What are you doing?” Sun Hao’s voice was gentle, yet tinged with coldness.

Well… that impression remained unchanged.

He seemed like a hidden villain from a palace drama, patiently waiting to overthrow the emperor.

“Sitting by the riverbank, the place I brought you last time.”

“Alone?”

“With Xiaoqing.  What about you?”

“In the school park.”

“Doing what in the park?”

“Without you, I can only look at the scenery to pass the time.”

“Oh, you smooth talker, what are you really doing?”

“Taking a walk. I miss you.”

Su Yuqing’s goosebumps arose. She wanted to roll on the grass to get rid of them…

“Well, how’s class lately?”

“Mmm, alright.”

“Are you paying attention?”

“Of course.”

“Still smoking?”

“Haven’t smoked all day.”

“Mmm~ Don’t smoke, it’s bad for your health. Take care of yourself.”

“You too.  Going to the riverbank today, did you miss me?”

“Ahem!  Well… missing you was incidental… incidental… incidental…”

“Then what’s the main reason?”

“It’s… mmm… mmm…”

“Shy?”  His voice held a faint smile, a hint of condescension, as if everything was under his control.

Not confident, but arrogant…

“I’m not!” Zhang Sifan’s face was crimson, probably more so because of Su Yuqing.

Couples’ conversations were… mushy…

Would she be like that someday?

Su Yuqing wondered, walking to the edge of the riverbank, out of earshot of Zhang Sifan’s call.

Without Su Yuqing, Zhang Sifan would probably talk more freely.

Su Yuqing squatted, gently touching the river water.

The weather was warm, but the water was cool, refreshing.

Su Yuqing stirred the water, creating a small whirlpool. A tiny fish was caught in it, struggling to escape. Su Yuqing played, making the whirlpool bigger and faster. The fish, dizzy, barely struggled.

Su Yuqing got carried away, leaning forward, lost her balance, and fell towards the river.  Just as she was about to fall, someone caught her.

“Careful.” A magnetic voice, calm and reassuring.

“Mo… Mo… Mokong…” Su Yuqing’s face flushed, looked back, then lowered her head.

“…Ahem, sorry.” Mokong realized his hand was on Su Yuqing’s chest, awkwardly let go, and made an awkward joke. “Mmm, you need to eat something nutritious.”

Su Yuqing blushed, covering her chest.  She was about to step back when Mokong grabbed her again.

“It’s the river behind you…” Mokong said helplessly.

“…”

Su Yuqing and Mokong looked at each other. Su Yuqing thought she would be shy first, but Mokong turned away.

“I… I have breasts…” Su Yuqing blurted out.

“??” Mokong looked confused. Seeing Su Yuqing’s crimson face, he realized she was responding to his joke…

Su Yuqing looked at her feet, not knowing what to say. Should she ask why he was there? Too stupid. Ask where he lived? Too direct. Ask about interesting stories?  Yes… that.

Su Yuqing looked up, but Mokong was gone.

He left without a word!

Su Yuqing pouted angrily.  So rude! He should have said something before leaving!

She looked around.  The empty riverbank offered no hiding places. Only Zhang Sifan, still on the phone, was visible.

“Mysterious and sneaky, definitely up to no good!” Su Yuqing stomped angrily, walking back to Zhang Sifan.

Zhang Sifan’s call ended.

“Bye~”

“Kiss.”

“Mwah~” Zhang Sifan said in a sweet voice, smiling happily.

“…” Su Yuqing stared at her expressionlessly.

“What’s wrong, Xiaoqing? Your sad face is ugly.”

“Humph… nothing.” Su Yuqing pouted, walking towards the road, Cookie and Coffee following. “I’m going home.”

“What’s wrong? Jealous?” Zhang Sifan stood up, hugged Su Yuqing, and nuzzled her back. “I like Xiaoqing too~”

Zhang Sifan put Su Yuqing on her electric bike, Cookie and Coffee in the basket, and they left.

In the river, a figure emerged. Mokong, soaked, held a large crab, waving towards the shore. “Look…”

“Huh? Where’d they go?”

…
