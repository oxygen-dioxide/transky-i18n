# 23. Female Wolf?

Bright sunlight streamed through gaps in the curtains, illuminating the desk in a neatly sliced beam of light, elegant and peaceful.

Another beautiful day.

"..." Su Yuqing struggled to sit up in bed.  Waking near dawn, she felt as if a thousand-pound weight pressed on her chest, preventing her from sleeping or rising.

That feeling of wrestling with herself, struggling within a dream, was agonizing.

Su Yuqing rubbed her chest, noticing something different. The muscles felt stiff, a dull ache present when she pressed on them.

A warm breeze drifted in through a crack in the window, making Su Yuqing feel comfortable.

It was already eight o'clock in the morning. The sun hung high in the sky; it must be warm outside.

Warm but not hot spring weather was one of Su Yuqing's favorites.  However, she preferred the drier autumn to the more humid spring.

Spring was warm, autumn was cool. While the temperatures were similar, the cool autumn breeze felt like it washed away all the grime.

"Ugh...these pimples are still so big...this one's gotten even bigger..." Su Yuqing groaned, gently poking the largest pimple on her forehead. She examined it in the mirror, wanting to pop it but fearing a scar.

"Fine...I'll just leave it alone..." Su Yuqing sighed, squeezing a small amount of milky white liquid from her single tube of face wash and applying it to her face.

She couldn't use cheap face wash; it had to be at least mid-range. This particular brand represented a significant portion of her spending and needed to last at least a month or two. After all, she wouldn't have a salary next month.

Su Yuqing hadn't always been so frugal.  At home, they used imported face wash, generously applying a large amount to their faces, sometimes even using two or three pumps per wash.

Life's pressures, it turned out, can cure even the most fastidious habits.

Now, Su Yuqing squeezed out the tiniest amount, spreading it carefully across her face, working it into a lather before rinsing thoroughly.

If the face wash was scarce, she’d just rinse more times.

After washing up, Su Yuqing lingered, enjoying the extra time before heading out. The walk wasn’t long.

She opened the window, letting in the fresh air.  Su Yuqing lived on the third floor of a row of farmer's houses, which was relatively high up, so she didn't have to worry too much about burglars.

Besides, there wasn't anything valuable to steal.

Opening the window, she realized she hadn't brought in the laundry she'd hung out two days prior. Luckily, it hadn't rained yesterday, otherwise it would have been soaked.

Su Yuqing gathered the clothes, carefully folding them and putting them away. The weather was getting warmer. While not needing a daily shower, she still needed to wash and change clothes every two or three days, so keeping the clean clothes was crucial.

Taking her keys and water bottle, Su Yuqing arrived at the noodle shop. The shop wasn’t busy yet; the owner and his wife chatted leisurely.

"Xiaoqing, you're here." Aunt Zhang greeted her as always.

"Yes, I'm here..." Su Yuqing’s work hours had been shifted, so she didn’t dawdle, immediately diving into her tasks: washing dishes, wiping tables, mopping the floor…

The work was mundane but not strenuous; she’d gotten used to it.

Would that person be here today?

Su Yuqing wondered as she opened a packet of vinegar and filled the empty bottle. She was responsible for replenishing the condiments.

"Boss~ a bowl of zhajiangmian!" A slightly low, feminine voice called from the entrance.  Su Yuqing looked up, seeing a tall woman with long, golden hair elegantly settle into a chair.

She was probably about five foot seven, tall even for a woman, and her high heels added another two or three inches. Compared to her, Su Yuqing, barely five foot five, looked like a delicate little "loli."

Her face was round, almost oval, her features not exquisite but with fair, smooth skin. The only flaw was a slightly large nose, somewhat out of proportion.

It was normal; not every woman possessed Su Yuqing's refined features—though Su Yuqing wasn’t exactly a "girl"...

Su Yuqing filled a small green container with pepper, glancing again at the woman.  She felt an inexplicable familiarity, a sense of closeness.

But this was her first time seeing the woman.

Perhaps she was just very approachable.

"Coming right up!" Li, the owner, quickly heated the pan, tossing in the noodles.

"Oh, Boss, when did you hire such a cute little helper?  She must be underage, right?" The woman, who seemed to be familiar with the owner, asked without hesitation.

"Hee hee!  Pretty, right?"

"Pretty, pretty…I want to marry her." The woman joked.

"You'd have to be a man first," Aunt Zhang chuckled. "Xiaoqing is a boy."

"Huh?!—" The woman looked surprised, incredulous at Su Yuqing's delicate features. "Really…a boy?"

"Why would I lie to you? Xiaoqing's just prettier than other boys. But, you young people these days, you like this type of pretty boy, right?"

"This is beyond pretty…she's more beautiful and adorable than any girl…" The woman smacked her lips, sighing.

"Haha, you can't marry him, but you could marry her?" Li, who was still cooking, quipped.

"Too big of an age gap…" The woman shook her head, though she seemed genuinely interested.  She looked at the baseball cap Su Yuqing wore. "Little boy…what's your name?"

"Su…Su…Su Yuqing…" Su Yuqing stuttered. She was shy around men, even more so around women. Being able to speak at all was a recent accomplishment.

"Such a feminine name…why are you wearing a hat? Let me see."

"Um…" Su Yuqing hesitated, looking at the owner, who smiled encouragingly.  Since it was a customer's request, she should comply. It was just taking off a hat, not a big deal.

Su Yuqing hesitated before removing her cap.

Luckily, there was only one other customer, minimizing awkward stares.

The woman looked at Su Yuqing’s buzz cut, expressing surprise.  Su Yuqing bristled slightly. Was this the mandatory reaction to her hairstyle?

"So…so cruel…" The woman uttered.

Su Yuqing realized that the woman’s expression included not only surprise but also pity and disapproval.

"..." Su Yuqing put her hat back on, silent.

"With such a pretty face, why get a buzz cut? At least keep it longer, like some of those popular stars…"

"..." Su Yuqing remained silent.

"But, if you cut it yourself…didn't you do it willingly? Um…" The younger woman pondered, eventually stopping, to Su Yuqing’s relief.  She didn't want to be interrogated.

"Xiaoqing, serve the noodles." The owner called from the kitchen.

"Oh…coming…" Su Yuqing hurried back to the kitchen, carefully carrying a bowl of zhajiangmian to the young woman.

Su Yuqing always served carefully, especially when she had time.  Even a full bowl of noodles wouldn't spill a drop.

The woman smirked, lightly touching Su Yuqing's soft buttock.

"Ugh!" Su Yuqing gasped, nearly dropping the noodles.  The woman acted nonchalantly, smiling, "What's wrong?"

"No…nothing…" Su Yuqing shook her head, hurrying to a corner, as if proximity to the woman was dangerous.

Su Yuqing's face was flushed, a mix of alertness and fear that amused the young woman, nearly making her spit out her noodles.

Su Yuqing didn't understand the woman's sudden touch…could she be a female wolf?
