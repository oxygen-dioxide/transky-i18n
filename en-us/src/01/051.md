# 51. Cookie's Company at Work

“Um…that’s…its companion…” Su Yuqing explained stiffly, after all, cats and mice getting along peacefully was quite rare.

“I’ve never seen that before,” Aunt Zhang reached out a hand to touch Cookie’s ear. The latter remained languid, curled up in the chair too lazy to move.

“Isn’t this a wild mouse? It looks a bit like the pet mice they sell at the pet market.”

Although she wanted to tell Aunt Zhang that it was indeed a wild mouse, she was worried that she would be disgusted, so Su Yuqing didn’t say anything in the end.

Aunt Zhang and Boss Li didn’t dislike stray cats, sometimes they would even put leftover food in bowls at the door for stray cats and dogs to eat. Moreover, Cookie looked so clean, so there was naturally no problem.

“Xiaoqing, your hair is so long, you should go get a haircut,” Aunt Zhang smiled gently, “Otherwise, you really look like a girl.”

Su Yuqing wiped the sweat from her forehead, a little helpless.  It felt like Tiger had just said this to her yesterday…

Su Yuqing certainly wouldn't go get a haircut herself, so she just mumbled a few perfunctory excuses.

For Su Yuqing, it wasn’t long enough yet; it barely reached her ears.  It should at least cover her ears.

With her hair growing longer, Su Yuqing wore hats less often.  She wore hats to cover up her “ugly” short, flat haircut. Now, although it wasn't long, it was at least within a range Su Yuqing could accept.

With society becoming increasingly open, girls with short hair like Su Yuqing’s weren’t uncommon, but most of them were tomboys, unlike Su Yuqing who looked so gentle and lovely.

It was another sunny day, the sun was bright. Although it was only a little after nine o'clock, it felt like noon. The sun shone on people, making them sweat slightly. But the good thing about spring compared to summer was that although it was sweaty, the occasional breeze made it feel cooler.

As usual, after eating the breakfast Boss Li made for her, Su Yuqing started work.

Although the weather was nice today, there weren’t many people coming to eat noodles. This was normal. Business was like that, sometimes it rained and a lot of people would come, and sometimes the weather was exceptionally good and no one would come…

Su Yuqing liked this kind of time. She had work, but it wasn’t too busy. She could do things slowly one by one.

“Your pig liver noodles~” Su Yuqing carried a bowl of noodles and quickly walked to a customer's side to put it down, without spilling a single drop of soup.

After working for a month, Su Yuqing was very skilled at carrying plates and serving dishes. Her balance was much better than when she first started working.

The customers who came in were all curious about Cookie and Coffee, but no one treated Coffee as a wild mouse. They only thought it was some kind of special breed of pet rat…

Speaking of which, Coffee did look a bit like a pet rat. Its tail was short, a bit like a rabbit's tail. Its head wasn't so pointy, it was a bit round, and its mouth was rather flat…

Coupled with its clean, satin-like fur, it was normal to mistake it for a pet rat.

Under Cookie’s supervision, Coffee didn’t run around. At most, it would dart around Cookie, sometimes scrambling onto its back, sometimes jumping into its arms…

Cookie half-closed its eyes, not reacting much to Coffee’s jumping around, letting it use its body as a playground.

Only when Su Yuqing passed by would Cookie glance at her, and only after Su Yuqing left would it look away.

“Xiaoqing, you’re young, give me a hand,” Aunt Zhang waved her hand, calling Su Yuqing over and handing her a ledger, “Help me calculate this. Add the plus signs and subtract the minus signs. Don’t get it wrong.”

“Ah, okay.” Su Yuqing took the ledger and started calculating seriously on a piece of scratch paper.

Although she only went to junior high school, this kind of arithmetic problem was at the elementary school level. Of course, she could calculate it, it was just a little troublesome because she had to add and subtract.

This calculation was probably the noodle shop's gross profit…

“Subtract thirty for buying vegetables…add the income from the 8th noodle shop…” Su Yuqing mumbled softly while writing down numbers on the scratch paper. Because there were many things to calculate, almost the whole piece of scratch paper was filled.

And this calculation was quite troublesome, there were many decimal points, which increased the amount of calculation. Most of them had to be drafted, only a small part could be solved orally…

It's not that others couldn't be calculated orally, it's just that if those complex numbers were calculated orally, there might be mistakes…

After all, Su Yuqing's math scores had never been very good, at most, just a little above average…

The calculation process wasn’t stable because she had to stop her work to help serve dishes and plates, causing Su Yuqing to have to recalculate small sections several times…

“Nine hundred and sixty-seven.”  A gentle, slightly husky voice came from behind as Su Yuqing frowned and silently calculated.

“Huh?” Su Yuqing turned her head in confusion and saw a somewhat familiar young man standing behind her, smiling at her.

“Long time no see.” The young man said to himself, sitting down next to Su Yuqing.

“Ah…um…you are…Mo Kong?” Su Yuqing was stunned, then realized it. She looked at Mo Kong again. Seeing him also shifting his gaze to her, she quickly turned her gaze back to the ledger.

“Ha, what, you don’t recognize me?”

“Um…a little…” Su Yuqing nodded lightly, couldn’t help but glance at Mo Kong again.

Today, Mo Kong changed his previous unkempt appearance. He had shaved his beard clean, his hair was neatly combed, and he was wearing a black suit. He looked like a manager going to a company meeting.

He did have a bit of that temperament.

But wearing a suit to a small noodle shop like this felt a bit strange. How should I put it? It was probably what you call a different style.

“Nine hundred…nine hundred and sixty-seven…” Su Yuqing calculated the numbers on the ledger, exactly the same as what Mo Kong had said. She asked in surprise, “Hey…how did you calculate so fast…”

“Mental calculation, there are tricks, for example, this three hundred and sixty-seven minus seventy, you can directly subtract sixty-seven from seventy, leaving three, then subtract three from three hundred, it’s directly two hundred and ninety-seven, isn't this faster?”

“Oh…right…” These were all simple tricks, but Su Yuqing's comprehension of mathematics wasn't strong, so she always used the clumsy method of calculating digit by digit…

Su Yuqing and Mo Kong were quite familiar, at least in this small city, she didn’t know many people, and Mo Kong was definitely one of them.

Even though they were so familiar, for some reason, every time her eyes met Mo Kong’s, she felt a little awkward and shy…

“Boss, a bowl of pork kidney noodles! Add an egg!” Mo Kong shouted loudly towards Boss Li.

“Coming right up!”

“I haven’t seen you this week.” Su Yuqing said casually, as if she was just having an ordinary chat, but in fact, she did miss him a little…

Because besides Zhang Sifan, he was the one closest to her age among the people she knew in the small city.

“Of course I’m busy, I can’t live without making money!”

“…Aren’t you, writing novels?”

“Ha, yes, but I don’t necessarily get a lot of money. The royalties haven’t been much lately, so I have to do some ‘part-time’ work.”

“Did you go apply to be a manager?” Su Yuqing looked curious.

“Why a manager?” Mo Kong asked back with a smile.

“Because you’re wearing a suit…”

“Haha…who says wearing a suit must be a manager.” Mo Kong shook his head with a laugh, as if sighing at Su Yuqing's “naivety”, “I found a sales job.”

“Sales?”

“It’s about bringing in business, promoting products. You gather some user habits, choose customers who might buy that kind of product, and then go door-to-door to sell it.” Mo Kong patted his pocket, took out a box of mints, threw one into his mouth, and looked at Su Yuqing, “Want one?”

“No…” Su Yuqing shook her head gently.

“For example, someone often buys cosmetics, then there’s a high probability she will buy cosmetic products, and my job is to go to her door to sell this product, to promote the effects of this product.” Mo Kong continued to explain.

“Um…how are you doing?”

“Not good.” Mo Kong chuckled bitterly, “Many people don’t like sales. It’s a bit tiring, I plan to finish this week, get my salary, and then quit. I'll find another job.”

“Have you always been like this? Constantly changing jobs?”

“Yeah, no matter what kind of job it is, as long as I can do it, I’ll try it. Different jobs have different fun.”

“What’s the fun of sales?”

“Um…at least it taught me a lot of ways to curse without using foul language.” Mo Kong touched his nose humorously.

“Xiaoqing, your noodles are ready!”

“Okay, coming…” Su Yuqing quickly went to the kitchen and served Mo Kong's pork kidney noodles, placing them in front of him.

“You?” Mo Kong picked up a pair of chopsticks and asked somewhat randomly.

“Me? Me what?”

“Are you planning to continue working here?”

“Um…yes, I think it’s pretty good here. I don’t plan to change for now.”

“You’ll definitely change later.” Mo Kong said confidently.

“Well…I’ll think about that later…”

“Don’t want to think about those complicated things in the future?”

“Um…I guess so…”

“Then have you considered finding a boyfriend?” Mo Kong changed the topic so quickly that Su Yuqing almost couldn’t keep up.

“…”

“Shy?”

“I’m not!”
