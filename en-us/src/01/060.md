# 60 · Strike When the Iron is Hot

A roar like a clap of thunder, deafening even in the gale, preceded a figure bursting from around the corner.  He ran with long strides, not particularly fast, but with remarkable steadiness. His powerful physique gave the impression that the very ground trembled slightly beneath his feet.

While everyone was still stunned, the burly man had reached the green-haired punk, landing a punch square on his chest. A muffled thud was followed by the sickening crack of breaking bones.

“Aaah!” The green-haired punk howled in agony, his voice raspy, a far cry from his previous menacing expression.

There were more than three punks; there were five in total. The green-haired one's fall only seemed to enrage the others; they lunged at the burly man, brandishing baseball bats and even knives.

They figured that even the strongest man couldn't stand against four punks armed with weapons.

Unfortunately for them, these punks, despite their wannabe gangster posturing, lacked the fighting skills of actual gangsters.  Lazy and good-for-nothing, they bullied the weak and feared the strong; their bodies were weak, and these guys, who usually gasped for breath after running a hundred meters, were no match for the burly man.

Not even with weapons.

Eyes blazing, the burly man unleashed a powerful kick to the chest of a knife-wielding punk, sending him flying backward. The force of that kick was considerable…

Then, with a spin, he used his elbow to strike a punk on the temple, followed by a punch to another's face. The last one, still stunned, was grabbed and flung away, landing on top of the other two.

His strength was truly ferocious; he was a human beast…

What surprised Su Yuqing even more was that this raging brute was someone she knew—Hu Yuniu!

The same Hu Yuniu who spoke so softly, whose gentle demeanor had seemed at odds with his appearance, was merciless in a fight.

A punk lying behind Hu Yuniu staggered to his feet, a glint of malice in his eyes. He grabbed his knife and lunged at Hu Yuniu's back.

Before Su Yuqing could shout, "Watch out!", Hu Yuniu spun around, grabbed the punk, and hurled him towards the alley entrance—precisely where Su Yuqing was hiding.

Following that trajectory, the punk was almost certain to hit Su Yuqing.  A man weighs at least a hundred pounds; a direct hit on Su Yuqing's frail body could easily break a bone.

Even without a fracture, she'd be severely bruised…

Su Yuqing tried to dodge, but her body couldn't keep up with her brain's commands. She could only watch helplessly as the punk hurtled toward her…

Just then, a blurry figure appeared in Su Yuqing's vision. He quickly rushed to her side and punched the punk.

The impact had already weakened by then, and the punch stopped the punk in his tracks. He collapsed to the ground, apparently unconscious.

"Are you okay?" the man beside her asked softly, his voice magnetic, instilling a profound sense of security.  It felt like nothing could harm her as long as she stood by his side.

"It's you…? Mo Kong?" Su Yuqing exclaimed in surprise.

"Is that so strange?" Mo Kong smiled slightly, then looked at Su Yuqing again. "Really okay?"

"Um… really… okay…"

"That's good." Mo Kong breathed a sigh of relief, bent down, and picked up half a burning cigarette that had fallen from his mouth while running.  He chuckled sheepishly at Su Yuqing. "Cough… tight budget, gotta save."

"How are you here?" Su Yuqing didn't mind; she even thought his action of picking up the cigarette was cool, completely forgetting Hu Yuniu's earlier "heroics".

"Just passing by," Mo Kong shrugged, glancing at the burly Hu Yuniu.  He greeted him, "Brother, you're strong."

"It's… natural…" Hu Yuniu blushed, scratching the back of his head, his gaze wandering. He looked… like a shy girl. "You're not bad either."

The feeling was strange, but that's how he felt to Su Yuqing.

Mo Kong, however, remained composed.  "Coincidence," he said calmly.  "Smoke?"

"No… I don't smoke." Hu Yuniu smiled gently, his eyes like a wife looking at her husband…

Su Yuqing turned her head away; she couldn't bear to look.

Fortunately, the atmosphere didn't become awkward because there was an injured person who needed help.

Su Yuqing went to the battered boy, helped him up, and asked with concern, "How… are you feeling?"

"I'm… okay…" The boy barely opened his eyes, his speech slurred.

"Should I take you to the hospital?"

"No… I can… walk…"  The boy struggled to his feet, swaying slightly as he picked up his backpack.

Su Yuqing watched his staggering departure, wanting to ask his name, but when she looked back, he was gone.

"Um… hi…" Hu Yuniu fidgeted with his clothes, whispering, "I… my name is Hu Yuniu, what's yours?"

Mo Kong touched his nose.  He hadn't felt anything strange before, but now the atmosphere felt… awkward. He said awkwardly, "I'm… Mo Kong."

"It's a nice name."

Su Yuqing now suspected that this burly man was like her…

But… heavens, he was so big and strong. Could a man that strong really want to become a girl?

While it was possible, boys who want to become girls are usually more delicate-looking, even if they are tall…

Everyone has the right to choose their future.

Su Yuqing cautioned herself not to discriminate against anyone—if she couldn't accept others, how could she expect others to accept her?

"Your name is interesting too," Mo Kong said, his awkwardness gone, his usual calm returning.

"Is it?" Hu Yuniu asked, blushing.

"Well, I'll be going then. Let's meet again if we have the chance." Mo Kong said politely, glancing at Su Yuqing before turning to leave.

Su Yuqing felt a pang of wanting to keep him, but she didn't say anything.

However, someone else did.

"Um, where do you live?" Hu Yuniu blurted out, immediately realizing it was too direct.  He quickly added, "Maybe we're going the same way."

"Just ahead, not far. But I need to go somewhere else, so it's not convenient to go together."

Su Yuqing nodded lightly. Hu Yuniu looked slightly dejected, saying nothing, letting Mo Kong leave.

"Sigh…"

The wind was strong, but Hu Yuniu's sigh was clearly audible.

"What's wrong?" Su Yuqing saw his dejected and sad expression and felt a twinge of sympathy.  He seemed like a pitiful person.

"Nothing." Hu Yuniu walked to one of the punks, his face stern, his girlish demeanor gone, replaced by a strong and resolute expression.  "Call 120 yourself.  Don't let me see you again."

"Ugh… yes… yes…" The punk gritted his teeth, his eyes full of resentment, but he didn't dare say no.  Who knew when the burly man might get angry and throw him against the wall…

It was terrifying, truly terrifying.  That kind of strength… was he even human…?

The punk was deeply traumatized; he would likely avoid burly men like Hu Yuniu in the future.

Though slightly disheartened, Hu Yuniu forced a smile at Su Yuqing. "I'll walk you home."

"No… I'll take the main road. You should go home too." Su Yuqing pointed to the darkening sky.  "It's about to rain."

"Okay… goodbye."

"Goodbye."

Su Yuqing watched the burly man leave, his strong figure seeming so lonely and desolate.

Everyone has their own pain, everyone has their way of living…

Su Yuqing sighed softly, not glancing at the groaning punks, and turned to leave.

The incident had taken away her desire to go to the internet cafe.  She should go home before it rained.

Su Yuqing had only walked halfway when raindrops began to fall, like a prelude to a storm.  Soon after a few drops landed on her, the rain poured down like a silver river.

Su Yuqing ran home in the rain, only to find two "guests" waiting at her doorstep—Cookie and Coffee.

They were probably sheltering from the rain.

"Meow~" Cookie saw Su Yuqing, wet to the bone, stood up, and made way for her to open the door.

"Come in."

"Meow."

"Squeak."

Su Yuqing, seeing Cookie and Coffee inside, closed the door, told them, "Don't wander around," and ran to the bathroom.

She tossed her soaked clothes into a basin and turned on the shower.

The water temperature was just right, neither too hot nor too cold.  It might have been slightly cool for Su Yuqing, but it was still acceptable.

Su Yuqing didn't like taking baths with hot water from a basin; it was uncomfortable and difficult to clean herself thoroughly. She preferred showers, enjoying the plentiful water washing over her body—a true indulgence for someone with her cleanliness habits.
