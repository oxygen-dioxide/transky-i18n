# 27 · The Forum

In 2004, even regular internet cafes rarely saw women, let alone the seedy ones.  In a black internet cafe, a woman was a rare sight.

The underage boys sitting at their computers naturally assumed Su Yuqing was a girl. They couldn't help but steal glances, curious about why a girl would be at an internet cafe so late.

Su Yuqing lowered her head, tugging her baseball cap lower, and found a seat in the farthest corner.

This small city's black internet cafe used outdated computers.  Su Yuqing's family had an LCD monitor, but these were bulky CRTs.

The mice were trackball, not optical. A stuck ball could be a real hassle, and they weren't very responsive.

Still, they were sufficient for browsing the web and playing games like Legend.

Su Yuqing opened her browser, landing on Yahoo's search page. Back then, Baidu hadn't yet dominated, and Google hadn't truly entered China; Yahoo hosted Google's search engine.

Finding hidden forums like the one Su Yuqing sought was difficult using search engines. It was much easier to simply type in the URL.

Su Yuqing entered the link and pressed Enter. The forum began loading.

Since the forum's server was in Taiwan, loading was slow.

Though small, the forum was beautifully designed.

Instead of the main page, a pitch-black space appeared, and a glowing, closed door slowly materialized.

The door had two buttons: one for entering a code, the other for requesting access.

The first was for login; the second, for registration, requiring an invitation code or answering a series of questions.

Su Yuqing had an account and password.  She'd registered using the question method, discovering the forum by chance on another smaller forum and registering after researching the answers—some weren't online, requiring a trip to the library.

That small forum had opened Su Yuqing's eyes and introduced her to other trans girls.

"Trans girl" was the community's preferred term—softer and less insulting than "shemale" or "ladyboy."  Another term was "TS," perhaps more accurate.  TS stood for people unsatisfied with their sex assigned at birth and seeking bottom surgery to change it.

TS is the core concept of "trans girl"—TS is the framework, "trans girl" the decorative wrapper.

The distinction is necessary because not all members took hormones to become women. Some were "CDs"—cross-dressers seeking sexual gratification. They were essentially men, using cross-dressing for pleasure.

There were many more types, but I won't list them all.

People were more open-minded in that era, but trans girls remained a small community.  This forum was quiet.

The forum's background was a glittering starry sky. Each section was a mini animation, playing when the mouse hovered over it.

There were only four sections: Communication, Resources, Stories, and Pictures.

Resources' animation was a turning book. Su Yuqing clicked it; the threads were displayed as books on a shelf. She searched and found a thread about hormone therapy side effects.

The symptoms mostly matched Su Yuqing's, and she noted the potential future side effects, preparing herself for what might come.

After the Resources section, she went to Communication.  It was mostly casual chatter: some discussing current events, others venting, some sharing coming out stories for work, and many more trading fashion tips, makeup techniques, and boasting about their boyfriends.

Su Yuqing wasn't interested, so after browsing a few foreign news articles about surgery, she opened her inbox.

Su Yuqing had a few close friends on the forum. They'd never met, but they were close.  Perhaps the internet, plus shared experience, let them share what they couldn't in real life.

【Spring, how are you?  Haven't seen you on the forum for days!】

Su Yuqing's username was "Spring," and the message was from her closest friend, "Moon Orange," who she'd even considered meeting in person.

【I've been discovered. I left home and am living alone.】Su Yuqing typed a reply.

She kept it vague, in case someone looked over her shoulder.

Even though she was cautious, she might miss something.

The forum's private messages were faster than email, serving as both instant messaging and email.

Su Yuqing was about to close the forum when she got a reply.  Moon Orange was also online.

【Your parents didn't approve…】

【Yeah.】

【Did they kick you out, or did you leave?】

【Both.】

【Oh… That’s awful. You're only fifteen, right? Can you manage alone? Need money? I can send some.】

【No… I found a job and rented a small apartment.】

【Oh~ That's good. How much do you make?】

【Three hundred.】

【Only three hundred? Minimum wage is six hundred.】

【Includes meals…】

【Mmm… Okay…  Still in Hangzhou?】

【No, I moved to a smaller city.】

【Oh? Which one?】

【A small city, lower cost of living.】

【I don't think I've told you where I live.】

【Yeah.】

【I live in a small city too!】

【Really?!】Su Yuqing was surprised and delighted. Finding a friend in the same city was exciting.

【Of course!  Let's meet sometime!】Moon Orange's excitement was clear.

【Next Monday? I have the day off.】

【Okay…  Let’s meet at the city center square. You should be able to find it.】

【Okay.】

【Let’s inform each other beforehand, just in case… Oh, give me your number.】

【I didn’t bring my phone.】

【…Alright, I’ll give you mine. Call me before you come.】

【Okay!】

And so it was settled.

Su Yuqing was excited. She'd never seen Moon Orange's picture; she wondered what she looked like.

Feminine?  Androgynous?  Masculine?

Su Yuqing wouldn't judge. Appearance didn't define someone.

Moon Orange was curious too, about the gentle "Spring."

But her curiosity was less intense. Fifteen-year-olds were unlikely to be mature, probably appearing quite youthful.

Su Yuqing closed the forum.  She had forty-five minutes left. She decided to watch anime.

It wasn't a new show or a popular one like Naruto, but an older anime: Ranma ½.

It was a rare transforming anime.

Su Yuqing envied Ranma, who could transform into a girl with cold water, reverting with hot water.

Ranma wanted to break the "curse," but Su Yuqing wished she could stay a girl forever.

Watching movies in internet cafes was common, but not anime in black internet cafes. The kids there were gamers; watching anime was wasting time and money.

The hour passed quickly. Only Su Yuqing and a boy who seemed to be staying up all night remained.

It was late—past ten.

Su Yuqing left the internet cafe, walked out of the alley, and returned to her tiny room.

“Time for bed…” It had rained on and off, so Su Yuqing wasn't sweaty and didn't need a shower.

The warmer weather had made the tap water more tolerable.  Even on rainy days, it was usable, so Su Yuqing washed up with tap water instead of boiling it.
