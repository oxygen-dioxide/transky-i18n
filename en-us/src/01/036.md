# 36 · Mount Bai Liu

“Come, give me your hand~”

“Huh?”

“Let me feel it.” Zhang Sifan grabbed Su Yuqing’s small hand without a word, gently kneading it a couple of times.  Like a seasoned old lech, he commented, “Hmm… not bad, not bad. Soft as boneless, exactly like a real girl’s… I’m so envious…”

Su Yuqing blushed and smiled, not knowing how to respond.

“Sisi…” Su Yuqing glanced at passersby, swallowing the “jie” (older sister) before quietly asking, “Why don’t you wear women’s clothes out?”

“It’s early today, no time for makeup. I’m a big sleeper, you know.  I only got up this early because I really wanted to see you… otherwise, I’d still be asleep.” Zhang Sifan smiled, looking at Su Yuqing’s face. “It’s also a side effect of the medication. I’m very sleepy these days…”

“Then, work?”

“No work… My family sends money…”

“They agreed?” Su Yuqing asked enviously.

“No… they don’t know. They think I’m in college…”

“You’re not?”

“I am… but it’s a third-rate university in a small city.  Whether I go to class or not doesn’t really matter…”

“I see…”

“If only I started taking the medication as early as you…” Zhang Sifan touched her face, somewhat dejectedly. “My skin wouldn’t be so rough…”

“Sisi… your skin is actually quite smooth.”

“That’s compared to men. My pores are still quite large, and I have an Adam’s apple.” Zhang Sifan lifted her neck and touched her Adam’s apple. “I have to cover it up every time… sigh…”

“Well… it’s already pretty good. At least, when you dress as a girl, there are no flaws.”

“Yeah… compared to others, I’m pretty good. But compared to you, I instantly lose confidence.” Zhang Sifan pouted. “You’re perfect from every angle…”

“…”

Su Yuqing couldn’t respond.

But the topic didn’t last long. Zhang Sifan’s mood changed quickly, and she immediately shifted to other topics.

“Speaking of which, you’re not in women’s clothes, Little Qing. Why don’t you come to my place? I’ll give you some?”

“Huh? No way…”

“Don’t be so polite. Are you shy?”

“It’s not that…” Su Yuqing shook her head, suddenly stopping, standing in front of Zhang Sifan, comparing their heights. There was a full head difference. “You’re so tall, your clothes won’t fit me.”

“That’s true… damn… your height is so enviable… I’m so jealous…” Zhang Sifan “viciously” hugged Su Yuqing, randomly grabbing at her chest, as if venting her “jealousy.”

“Eek—”

People around heard Su Yuqing’s gasp and instinctively looked at her, making her shyly cover her face and lower her head.

“Huh? Oh… I’m sorry, sorry…” Zhang Sifan immediately understood and quickly apologized.

“It’s… it’s okay…” Su Yuqing blushed, gently rubbing her chest, feeling a little more comfortable.

Su Yuqing’s breasts had already developed slightly, with two small lumps.  Pressing them hard hurt, with a tingling sensation. If she slept on her stomach at night, her chest would hurt the next morning…

Like a tumor.

Of course, Su Yuqing knew this was a normal phenomenon during breast development, even boys have it.  But… since she started taking medication during puberty, would she develop breasts like ordinary girls?

Su Yuqing was worried and expectant, feeling conflicted.

“But, I do have an outfit that would fit you.” Zhang Sifan said.

“Huh?”

“A Shrine Maiden costume.  It’s a bit large, but it should suit you. That kind of clothing being a bit large is fine.”

“Then… when I have money… I’ll pay you back…” Su Yuqing didn’t like owing favors, but the allure of women’s clothing was too strong, so she compromised.

“What are you saying? It’s a gift! Let’s go get it later. Now let’s go play!”

“Where to?”

“Mount Bai Liu!”

The small city’s Mount Bai Liu was located on the opposite side of the sea. Although it was a relatively famous scenic spot in the small city, very few people went there.

Firstly, the city was too small to attract tourists; secondly, the scenery wasn’t that good…

Mount Bai Liu was simply the highest mountain in the range, with many streams. That’s it.

The scenic area didn’t even have a management office, and few people went up the mountain; they mostly just looked at it from the bottom because—it was very high.

If one had to say there was something interesting about Mount Bai Liu, it was the old and dilapidated temple. But the temple was so dilapidated, and the small city had no intention of preserving this cultural relic, leaving it to decay.

If it were maintained, it could perhaps be used as a restaurant?

The 9 o’clock bus was much emptier than the one Su Yuqing took earlier.  Most of the seats were empty.  She and Zhang Sifan randomly chose a window seat. The anticipated awkwardness didn’t happen; they still had plenty to talk about.

Actually, once they relaxed, the difference from chatting through private messages on the forum wasn’t that big.

“Little Qing, you just ran out like this. Won’t your parents look for you?”

“I don’t know…” Su Yuqing watched the trees receding outside the window, letting the breeze caress her face. “Maybe they have, maybe they haven’t…”

“…” Zhang Sifan was silent for a while, then cautiously asked, “That… do you… miss them?”

“Hmm…”

“Sigh…” Zhang Sifan sighed deeply. “I wish parents could understand us…”

“It’s hard.” Su Yuqing’s expression was also somewhat desolate.  If possible, who would want to leave their parents’ protection at this age and live alone?

Living alone is hard.

Su Yuqing was content and didn’t feel bitter.  In fact, with a monthly salary of three hundred, after deducting one hundred and fifty for rent and almost one hundred for medication, and fifty for utilities, Su Yuqing only had a little over thirty left.

Thankfully, the noodle shop provided three meals a day; otherwise, Su Yuqing wouldn’t even be able to feed herself…

“I… wanted to tell my parents.” Zhang Sifan pinched her ears, muttering in confusion. “After all, I’ve been taking medication for two years… but… after seeing what happened to you… I really don’t know what to do.”

“…” Su Yuqing was silent. If she had a way, she wouldn’t be sitting here.

As for advising Zhang Sifan to stop taking the medication?  Even Su Yuqing couldn’t do it, so how could she ask others to?

“One step at a time… if it doesn’t work… I’ll live alone.” Zhang Sifan sighed heavily, her mood plummeting.

Su Yuqing seemed infected by her somewhat depressed mood, lowering her head and saying nothing.

After taking the medicine, emotions also became unstable, easily swinging between great joy and great sorrow, easily affected by the moods of others.

“By the way, Little Qing, you only take the medication, nothing else?”

“No…”

“Buy some vitamin tablets later, and calcium tablets.  The medication is still very harmful…”

“Hmm…”

“Little Qing, why do you want to become a girl?” Zhang Sifan tried to keep the topic from getting too heavy.

“Hmm… when I was little, my parents kind of raised me like a girl. Later… I don’t know why, I just gradually wanted to become a girl, and… that feeling got stronger and stronger…”

“I see…”

“Sisi… what about you?”

“Me? Well… because I want to, that’s it.  It’s that simple. There aren’t many reasons.”

“Right.”

The bus bumped along.

The two “abnormal” humans felt heavy in their hearts, falling silent, not knowing what they were thinking.

“Mount Bai Liu, arrived…”

“Little Qing, get off, get off~” Zhang Sifan nudged the sleeping Su Yuqing, her tone cheerful, as if the depressed person just now wasn’t her.

“Mmm… huh…? Ar… arrived?” Su Yuqing opened her eyes sleepily, dazedly asking.

“We’re here~ Little Qing, you’re so cute when you’re sleepy!”

“Huh?” Su Yuqing hadn’t quite come to her senses.

“Let’s go!” Zhang Sifan pulled Su Yuqing off the bus, taking a deep breath of the fresh air at the foot of the mountain, feeling that the pent-up air had been released.

“Hmm…” Su Yuqing shook her head, becoming slightly more alert. This was another side effect of the medication—sleepiness.

Always wanting to sleep; severely, sitting down would make her feel sleepy.  Some people also suffer from insomnia at night, but are always sleepy during the day…

“Are we going to climb up?” Su Yuqing looked at the towering mountain, unsure.

“Yeah~ Let’s climb to the top.” Zhang Sifan smiled mysteriously. “The top is very beautiful.”

“But… I’m worried… I won’t be able to climb it…” Su Yuqing looked at her thin body, saying with a lack of confidence.

“Let’s try. You won’t know unless you try! And, you need to exercise. Otherwise, your body will get worse.” Zhang Sifan pulled Su Yuqing without a word and walked onto the mountain path.

The mountain path didn’t go straight to the top but wound around.  Although it was much longer than going straight to the top, because there were steps, it was safe and… shouldn’t be too tiring.

Well… hopefully.
