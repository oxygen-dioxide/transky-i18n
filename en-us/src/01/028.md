# 28 · Mo Kong

It was a typically calm day, not raining, a partly cloudy day, you could say.

I say partly because the sun occasionally peeked out from behind the clouds before disappearing again.

This kind of weather was perfect for going out, especially since it was spring, ideal for sightseeing and the like.

Xiaocheng was a coastal city, but Su Yuqing had never been to the beach here.

Su Yuqing didn't like crowded beaches; perhaps Xiaocheng could offer her the charm of a deserted beach?

Maybe next Monday, I’ll go to the beach with Yuecheng?

“Is my beef noodle ready yet?” A customer who had been waiting at the table for a while impatiently shouted.

“Ah, coming!” Su Yuqing snapped out of her daze, picked up a bowl of beef noodles from the small table in the kitchen, and carefully placed it on the table where the customer was sitting.

Good weather meant good business. Today there were many more customers than yesterday. Since arriving, besides eating breakfast, Su Yuqing hadn’t stopped. There had been quite a few customers since nine o'clock, and now, at eleven, there were even more. Some people, seeing that all the tables were full, simply took their orders to go…

“Xiaoqing! Go to the supermarket and buy ten packs of pickled mustard greens, one-yuan packs! We're running out!” Zhang Auntie shouted from the kitchen.

“Coming…” Su Yuqing quickly ran back to the kitchen, took the ten-yuan bill from Zhang Auntie, and hurried towards a small supermarket nearby.

Su Yuqing didn’t like it when business was exceptionally good. It made her feel flustered, always afraid of messing things up. The more she worried, the more nervous she became, the slower and less efficient she was.

Of course, a slow day like yesterday was also boring. Time seemed to crawl.

Su Yuqing preferred a moderate level of business—enough customers, but not too many, allowing for a relaxed pace, without the rush.

The supermarket and the noodle shop were on the same street, not too far apart, maybe two or three hundred meters. But because she ran so fast, and Su Yuqing's stamina wasn’t good to begin with, by the time she reached the supermarket entrance, she was already gasping for breath.

Time was tight; Su Yuqing didn't have time to rest. Gasping for air, she ran into the supermarket, quickly found the shelf with the pickled mustard greens, grabbed ten one-yuan packs, and rushed to the checkout counter.

After paying, she sprinted back to the noodle shop.

Su Yuqing put the pickled mustard greens on the small table in the kitchen and leaned against the wall, gasping for breath.  She felt like she could barely stand.

“Whew… whew… so tired…” Su Yuqing wiped the sweat from her forehead, trying to rest, because during busy periods, rest was precious.

The distance, about five or six hundred meters, wasn't far, nor was it close. Although Su Yuqing's physique was already weak, she felt even weaker than before, and it had only been a few days.

Before, even running a kilometer wouldn't leave her breathless. Now, after only five or six hundred meters, she felt like a mountain was pressing down on her chest, making it difficult to breathe. Her vision blurred, and her head felt dizzy, as if she hadn't eaten for three days.

Su Yuqing slowly squatted down, leaning against the wall, gasping for breath. The kitchen fumes made her feel sick, but she couldn't help it. She was too weak to move to the outside.

“Xiaoqing, take that bowl of snow vegetable noodles to table six, the customer closest to the wall.” Zhang Auntie, busy with work, didn't see Su Yuqing's condition. She simply gave instructions with her back turned.

During busy periods, the owner and proprietress worked together.  The kitchen had two stoves, making noodles faster than one person could manage. Even then, they could barely keep up with the orders.

Customers came and left quickly, one batch after another, without a break. They were so busy that they could hardly clear the tables.

“Mm…” Su Yuqing took a deep breath, clutching her aching stomach from the strenuous activity, and slowly stood up.

This was work.  As long as she was working, no matter how uncomfortable, she had to do it. Su Yuqing didn't like to appear too weak; people would think she was useless and might fire her.

So she gritted her teeth and persevered, even when it was hard.

This time was no exception.

The brief rest eased Su Yuqing's breathing slightly. The weight on her chest felt like it had shrunk from a mountain to a large stone—still uncomfortable, but much better.

Su Yuqing's hands trembled as she picked up the bowl of noodles. She herself could barely walk, let alone carry a bowl of noodles. She walked unsteadily, and the more she tried to balance, the more she swayed. A few drops of hot soup spilled onto her hand. The burning pain made her want to drop the bowl, but she gritted her teeth and endured…

Su Yuqing finally reached the customer. All her attention was focused on the bowl of noodles. Reaching the table, she sighed in relief.

“Your noodles…” Su Yuqing was about to relax when, due to her carelessness, she didn't hold the bowl steadily. Her left hand tilted, and the noodles were about to spill, possibly onto someone else…

“Careful.” Just as Su Yuqing's heart pounded, a large, somewhat rough hand gently supported her left hand, correcting the tilt. Then another hand reached out and took the bowl of snow vegetable noodles, placing it firmly on the table.

Su Yuqing looked up and saw a pair of deep, somewhat weathered eyes. He was a man who at first glance seemed special but on closer inspection looked quite ordinary.

Yes, it was the man who had told Su Yuqing stories, perhaps the man who had woken her up on the train, an unkempt young man.

“Th-thank you!” Su Yuqing's face flushed red, not only from embarrassment but also from shyness, because when the young man's hand had supported the bowl, it had completely enveloped Su Yuqing's right hand…

Su Yuqing felt her heart racing. Her heart hadn't fully recovered from the exertion, but this felt different…

“It's alright. Go ahead and get back to work.”

Su Yuqing lowered her head, hesitated, and cautiously looked up, finally stammering, “Th-that… uh… what's your… cough… uh…”

“Oh, my name. I forgot to tell you last time. I'm Mo Kong. You can also call me Mo Cheng.”

“Tw-two names?” Su Yuqing was puzzled.

“Mo Kong is the name on my ID card. Mo Cheng is a name I gave myself.  Perhaps you can consider it my pen name.”

“Mo… Mo Kong…?” Su Yuqing finished his name and shyly lowered her head again.

“Yes, nameless ‘Mo,’ sky ‘Kong.’” Mo Kong took a pair of disposable chopsticks from the chopstick holder, unwrapping them while asking, “If you don't mind, can you tell me your name?”

“I… ah… that… I’m… Su… Su… Su… Yuqing…” Su Yuqing stammered.

“Suzhou ‘Su,’ raining ‘Yu,’ sunny ‘Qing’?” Mo Kong asked.

“Mm…”

“What a beautiful name.” Mo Kong smiled.

“Xiaoqing—take this fried noodle to…” The proprietress’s voice came from the kitchen.

“Go ahead and get back to work.” Mo Kong looked at Su Yuqing and smiled gently.

“Mm… mm…” Su Yuqing, relieved, ran back to the kitchen, but along with the relief came a faint sense of reluctance?

Did Su Yuqing want to chat with Mo Kong a little longer?

Business was booming; the noodle shop was busy. Su Yuqing’s mind was blank, mechanically following the proprietress’s instructions.

Similarly, she temporarily forgot about Mo Kong.

And when she paused, Mo Kong was gone.

Of course, customers who ate at the noodle shop would leave after finishing their meal.  Especially during the peak period, if they didn't eat and still occupied a seat, a bad-tempered customer might fight.

At 2:30 pm, only one customer was leisurely eating noodles. Su Yuqing finally breathed a sigh of relief.

There was no more hurry; she only needed to slowly clean up.

Because of the earlier rush, she hadn’t cleared the tables, simply pushing them aside before serving new customers. Only when they were piled up did she rush to clear them.

Looking at the messy tables, Su Yuqing felt a sense of melancholy.

She should be happy, right…

After clearing the dishes, they had to be washed in a large basin.  There were other things to do: wiping tables, stacking chairs, restocking condiments, and various other small tasks…

Fortunately, the evening business wasn't as busy as during the day. There were still customers, but within a normal range.

Soon, it was closing time.

Su Yuqing stretched at the entrance of the noodle shop, feeling sore all over.  If it was this busy and tiring every day, Su Yuqing wouldn't last long before getting sick from exhaustion…

“Xiaoqing, tired?”

“Mm… very tired…” Su Yuqing replied honestly.

The proprietress handed Su Yuqing a bag with several boxes of milk, saying, “Take these boxes of milk home to drink. You're still developing, so you can’t lack nutrition.  Go home and rest; otherwise, you’ll be even more tired tomorrow.”

“Mm…! Thank you, proprietress…”
