# 6 · My First Job

Perhaps good fortune follows misfortune.  Although Su Yuqing hadn't found her wallet, she discovered three hundred-yuan bills in the lining of her suitcase.

She had no idea when she'd put them there. Maybe it was from a past trip; she'd completely forgotten about them.

Even now, Su Yuqing couldn't remember when she'd hidden the money.

Even if it was her own money, the joy was indescribable.

Many people have had similar experiences – running low on cash, only to find a hundred-yuan bill in their pocket, feeling like they'd won a lottery.

Su Yuqing felt much the same.

Having money in her pocket made things easier. At least, even if she ended up on the streets, she wouldn't have to worry about food for a few days.

"Achoo!" Su Yuqing sneezed, rubbing her delicate nose. She felt like she might be coming down with a cold.

In a strange city, without a stable life, getting sick would be a major problem.

Dawn broke, and the small city started to bustle. Street breakfast vendors were always the first to open, catering to the hardworking people who rose early.

More and more people filled the streets, creating a lively atmosphere.

The city, while not as bustling as Hangzhou, wasn't deserted either.  More importantly, the pace of life was noticeably slower.  Most pedestrians were relaxed and leisurely; schoolchildren were brimming with happiness, laughing and playing with their classmates. Their clear, pure laughter carried across the street.

It felt pure and heartfelt.

If Su Yuqing were still in school, she'd be on her way to class right now, wouldn't she?

But Su Yuqing's junior high school started very early, requiring her to be at school before 7:30 am.  Every school day was a rush, as was the evening, with homework piling up at home.

Su Yuqing suddenly envied those children who could still attend school, and even more, she envied their ordinary lives, especially the girls…

If she'd been born a girl, things would have been so much better. She wouldn't have been bullied as an outcast at school, nor would she have clashed with her parents. She could have grown up peacefully under their protection…

Did she regret it? Maybe.

But her desire to become a girl was even stronger. She wished her parents could understand her…

Su Yuqing couldn't resist the aroma from a street breakfast stand.  She bought a large steamed bun and a bag of soy milk, using a crisp hundred-yuan bill.  She ate as she walked.

A bag of soy milk and a large steamed bun cost only a dollar – incredibly cheap.

The soy milk in this small city came in bags, unlike in Hangzhou, where it was served in disposable cups like奶茶 (milktea).

This bagged soy milk was inexpensive, made from instant soy milk powder. But Su Yuqing wasn't picky about food, especially now, living alone. Having something to eat was already good enough.

A warm steamed bun and soy milk filled her up.  She patted her still-flat stomach and started searching for work.

Her method was simple: check shop windows for "help wanted" signs.

There were quite a few. Su Yuqing stopped at a grocery store, hesitating before entering.

"Little girl, what do you want?" The owner, eating breakfast, asked.

"Th-that…" Su Yuqing lowered her head, nervously fidgeting with her clothes, whispering, "A-are you…hiring?"

"Ah…yes?" The owner looked surprised. This "girl" looked only fifteen or sixteen, still of school age. Why was she looking for a job so early? She probably hadn't even finished junior high, right?

"That…I…"

"You want to work here?" The owner asked, observing Su Yuqing. Her limbs were slender, suggesting a lack of strength.  She had a pretty face and fair skin – not like a poor child's. More like a rich girl. The experienced owner quickly judged: a runaway rich kid trying to make her own way?

"Y-yes…" Under the owner's sharp gaze, Su Yuqing lowered her head further.  Her baseball cap's brim completely concealed her face.

"Where are your parents?"

"Th-they…aren't…"

"Do your parents know you're looking for a job?"

"..."

"I can't hire child labor."  The owner dismissed Su Yuqing, concerned about potential trouble. If her parents showed up, there would be a hassle.

Chinese pragmatism favored avoiding trouble whenever possible, especially for shrewd businessmen.

"Okay…" Su Yuqing dejectedly walked away, glancing back, hoping the owner would change their mind.

But the owner calmly continued eating breakfast, showing no intention of changing their mind.

Su Yuqing left.

For a fifteen-year-old to find a job wasn't easy, but it wasn't impossible either.

She received various rejections:  "No ID, no hire," "No child labor," or directly demanding her parents' consent.

Some places were willing to hire, but their stares made her uncomfortable – cold, malicious smiles that sent chills down her spine.

This reminded her of the dream she'd had yesterday. She fled in fear.

Street after street, everything looked unfamiliar.  No place suited her, and evening approached.

The setting sun cast its less-warm glow, painting everything in a blood-red hue.

Su Yuqing's feet ached; each step felt like needles pricking her soles.

She'd never walked so far.  Her feet were probably blistered.

In the Little Mermaid story, the princess endured walking on needles to gain human legs. Su Yuqing felt much the same.

Su Yuqing turned onto another street, quieter than the last, with fewer pedestrians but several open shops.

She habitually looked at street signs to memorize names, creating mental markers.

This name seemed familiar.

"Bai Shi Road…?" She muttered, feeling like she'd heard it before, but couldn't recall where.

It's normal to feel a sense of déjà vu in new places. Su Yuqing dismissed it and continued walking.

Her aching feet forced her to take small steps.  Outsiders might think she was dainty, but who would know the pain she was enduring?

A small noodle shop had a "help wanted" sign.

【Hiring noodle shop helper.  Dishwashing, table cleaning, serving.  Wage negotiable.】

She expected rejection, but wouldn't give up. To survive, she needed a job.

"Um… are you…hiring?" Su Yuqing's voice was slightly hoarse from talking all day.

"Little girl, are you looking for work?" A kind-looking owner asked.

"Yes…"

"How old are you?"

"…Fif…fifteen." Su Yuqing hesitated, then told the truth.

"So young? Where are your parents?" The owner didn't seem surprised.

"…They…aren't…" Su Yuqing clutched her suitcase, ready to leave.  Another rejection, she thought.

"Do you really want this job?"

"Yes…" Su Yuqing nodded.  "I…want a…stable job…"

"Running low on money, huh?"

Su Yuqing's face flushed, but she nodded.

"It'll be hard work, low pay – three hundred a month, but meals are included. Can you handle that?"

"Yes!" Su Yuqing felt a glimmer of hope. Her weariness lifted.  She nodded vigorously. "Yes!"

"Alright, you can start tomorrow."

"Thank you!"

Su Yuqing was grateful. Tears welled up.

Finally, she had her first job…

A sense of satisfaction and accomplishment washed over her.
