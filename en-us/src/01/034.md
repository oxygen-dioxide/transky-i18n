# 34. A Crowded Morning

Time flows forward, steadily and relentlessly. Sometimes it feels slow, sometimes fast, but its speed remains constant.

Looking back, though, the past always seems to have flown by in a flash.

March 15th. For most, just another day. But for Su Yuqing, it held special significance—today, she was meeting Yuecheng, someone just like her.

This was Su Yuqing's first meeting with an online friend, and her excitement was palpable.  She’d tossed and turned until late last night, yet woke up very early this morning.

March 15th, 2004, Monday.

Su Yuqing checked the calendar again, confirming today was her day off, confirming she hadn't misread the date, before heading to the bathroom to wash up.

With only two outfits to choose from, selection was limited. She settled on a loose shirt and reasonably loose jeans.

She'd been taking hormones for almost two weeks. The changes weren't drastic, but Su Yuqing felt different, though she couldn't quite articulate how.

The biggest difference was her chest. While not larger, her breasts were slightly more prominent.  They were sensitive to the rough fabric of her shirt; wearing just one layer might show nipples…

That would be awkward.

So, Su Yuqing always wore a camisole underneath.

Maybe someday…she’d buy women’s underwear…

The thought brought a blush to her cheeks. She shook her head, pushing away the blush-inducing thoughts, until she calmed down.

It was still early, but unfamiliar with the city, Su Yuqing preferred to leave early.  Getting lost would mean being late.

Su Yuqing disliked being late. She preferred arriving early and waiting.  It was a habit from her job, where she always arrived early.  She didn't actually need forty minutes to get ready; twenty was enough for washing and walking to the noodle shop.

She'd considered a taxi, but money was tight. Even the bus felt extravagant.  Every penny counted.

Su Yuqing glanced at the Barbie doll on the windowsill, regretting the purchase once again…

Monday streets were bustling, always filled with traffic and pedestrians. Breakfast shops were especially crowded.

Su Yuqing tucked most of her hand into her oversized sleeves, only her fingers peeking out, clutching the fabric.  She walked with her head down, appearing delicate and frail.

Breakfast was a meat bun; she skipped the soy milk, having brought her own water. Saving money on drinks.

The city center’s central square was well-served by buses. Su Yuqing had asked Zhang Auntie yesterday; several buses from the stop on the next street went directly there.

Morning buses were frequent, perhaps to accommodate commuters.

Su Yuqing waited only a short while. She’d just finished her meat bun when a bus to the central square arrived.

Mondays weren't holidays; morning buses were packed. Commuters and students jostled for space, desperate to board.

Su Yuqing watched, stunned, as the small bus filled to the brim, resembling a sardine can, teetering on the verge of bursting.  Even starting the engine felt shaky…

She'd never experienced this.  Her parents always drove her to school; she'd never encountered such crowds. Her home was near a bus terminus; this was unprecedented…

Lost in thought, Su Yuqing didn’t board. Even if she tried, her small frame would likely be unsuccessful.

"They won't suffocate?" Su Yuqing murmured, a mix of wonder and disbelief. "Amazing…"

Several more buses came and went, all too crowded. She waited for an emptier one…

But it was rush hour.  Unless after nine, the buses would only get more crowded, possibly becoming immobile if no one got off.

Su Yuqing had arranged to meet Yuecheng at nine. Leaving at nine would make her late.  She gritted her teeth and boarded a bus.

Immediately, she regretted it.  The crowded bus reeked of a bizarre mix of sweat, body odor, perfume, and breakfast.

The combined smells were nauseating; one breath was enough to make her stomach churn…

Su Yuqing wanted to get off, but couldn't.  She was passively pushed further inside by the passengers behind her…

She resigned herself to her fate.

After paying, the doors closed, and the bus started. People were pressed together, leaving no space.

Su Yuqing was short, now squeezed in the crowd, struggling to breathe.  She tried to stretch upwards for air, but the bus swayed, making her unsteady.

"Screech"—a sudden brake.  Passengers swayed, pushed, and squeezed.  Su Yuqing felt like she was becoming a human pancake…

She hoped never to take a rush-hour bus again…

Observing the passengers holding onto the railings, their calm demeanor seemed to suggest they were used to this.  Su Yuqing felt a deep admiration for their resilience…

In that foul-smelling, cramped bus, they remained composed…

Su Yuqing couldn't.  Her brow furrowed constantly.

Several times, her baseball cap almost fell off. She held onto a railing with one hand, the other pressing firmly on her cap.

The bus started and stopped. Besides the announcements, Su Yuqing couldn't tell where they were. Looking around, she only saw other people's chests or backs…

"Central Square, arriving, passengers please…" The announcement was heavenly music to Su Yuqing’s ears.  Squeezed in the crowd, she saw a gateway to salvation, desperately trying to escape…

Her small frame made maneuvering relatively easy, but it was still too slow.  As she neared the door, it closed.

"Aaah!" Su Yuqing pounded on the door, so flustered she couldn't speak properly.

Fortunately, the driver, presumably with a monitor, saw her.  The doors reopened. Su Yuqing jumped out, like escaping, taking a deep breath on the platform.

"Whew… never again," Su Yuqing wiped her sweat, adjusting her crumpled clothes, then sniffed them…

The foul smell lingered; she felt allergic.

…Perhaps it was psychosomatic…

"Central Square jewelry store…" Su Yuqing looked around. This was the outer perimeter, lined with breakfast and restaurants. Any jewelry store wouldn’t be Yuecheng's.

But Su Yuqing couldn’t find the entrance to Central Square…

"Where…?" Su Yuqing searched twice, feeling exhausted, breathing heavily.

Without the entrance, she’d have to ask for directions.

Usually simple, this was difficult for Su Yuqing. She wasn’t sure who to ask…

A random passerby? What if they didn't know? Shop owners?  They'd be annoyed without a purchase…

Su Yuqing anxiously looked around, settling on a sanitation worker in orange.

Sanitation workers knew the area well…

Su Yuqing approached, opening her mouth, but no sound came out.

The sanitation worker glanced at her, puzzled by the "girl" standing there.

Speak, speak!  Su Yuqing urged herself, finally managing a few words.

"Th-th-that… Auntie…  P-please! Entrance… where’s the entrance…?" Su Yuqing stammered.

"Entrance? Oh, Central Square’s entrance?"

Su Yuqing nodded vigorously.

"There, straight ahead, then left, straight again, that’s the main entrance."

"Th-thank you!"
