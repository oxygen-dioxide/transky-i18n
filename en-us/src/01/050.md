# 50. Cookie, Good Morning

Because of tonight's events, Su Yuqing, almost without exception, had a nightmare.

She dreamed that she was pressed to the ground and subjected to wanton humiliation, countless people surrounding her, trampling on her dignity.

Her whole body was covered in wounds, blood constantly flowing out. She felt her strength dwindling, her body growing colder. Even curling up tightly, she couldn't find much warmth.

Will I die? Am I going to die? If I'm going to die, please hurry up…

In her dream, Su Yuqing thought hazily, using the last vestiges of her consciousness.

Not all dreams are lucid dreams like the ones in the park. More dreams leave you completely unaware within the dream that it's merely a dream.

Some dreams are very real, or rather, the feeling they give Su Yuqing is very real.

"No… no… no!" Su Yuqing suddenly opened her eyes, but instead of the slightly illuminated ceiling from the streetlights outside, she saw a gloomy sky.

A light drizzle fell from the sky, drop after drop landing on Su Yuqing. The surrounding trees swayed, their shadows clawing like monsters…

This wasn't Su Yuqing's room; it was another dream.

Su Yuqing already sensed that she might be dreaming, but she couldn't open her eyes no matter what.

What kind of dream is the most terrifying? Perhaps this kind of multi-layered dream, from which one seems never able to escape, is the most terrifying.

Sometimes, people are so tired that even after the alarm clock rings, they turn it off, fall back asleep, and then dream of washing their face, brushing their teeth, and going out. Only when they wake up again do they realize they are still lying in bed.

That's relatively common. The maddening kind is when every time you open your eyes, it's a dream, but never reality, and you can never wake up… Isn't that terrifying enough?

Su Yuqing's eyes were somewhat listless. Even vaguely sensing that it was a dream, she was still disheartened by the humiliation inflicted upon her by those people.

Perhaps, her existence is a mistake? Otherwise, why do those people always bully me? Maybe I shouldn't be alive…

People like me…

Su Yuqing felt an emptiness in her chest, as if something was missing, something like… her heart.

She felt tired, slowly closing her eyes, then slowly opening them again.

It seems… I'm back to reality.

Everything around her was familiar: the doll on the bed, the bookshelves filled with books, the cute figurines…

Su Yuqing looked around in a daze, as if remembering something.

This was indeed her room, or rather, it used to be, but this wasn't where she currently was…

In the dream, she returned to the home where her parents existed?

Su Yuqing didn't push open the door, because she didn't want to see her parents' reproaches again, not even in a dream.

She closed her eyes again and opened them. This time, she was in the park.

But not at the park entrance, but directly standing in front of the swing.

A pretty boy lay on his back on the ground, his whole body covered in wounds. On his left arm, there was even a shocking wound, revealing the white bone inside. Blood slowly flowed from his body.

"Sister… you… came…" The boy managed a weak smile, apologetic. "Sorry… I can't… stand up yet…"

“…”

Su Yuqing shifted her gaze from the boy, but discovered many boys lying or sprawling on the ground in twisted positions, their figures similar to the pretty boy.

"They wanted to beat me, but this time, I fought back, and I killed them all…" The boy weakly pointed to a bloodstained brick next to his right hand. "With this brick…"

Su Yuqing didn't speak. She herself felt strange, as if all human emotions had vanished from her.

She looked around and suddenly found a small boy leaning against a tree, his head bowed. He was clearly dead, but…

Su Yuqing quickly walked to the dead boy, grabbed his chin, and lifted his head—

Human emotions seemed to return to her body at that moment. She widened her eyes, looking incredulously at the boy lying beside the swing.

Because… this boy looked exactly like him!

Su Yuqing seemed to think of something and turned over the other boys. Without exception, they all looked exactly like the boy who was still alive.

The scene was extremely eerie. Su Yuqing, who had almost no fear of the boy, couldn't help but feel her hair stand on end, a feeling of palpitation spreading through her heart.

"You…" Su Yuqing couldn't help but speak, but didn't know what to say.

"Crackle… crackle…" The streetlights began to flicker, and everything in the park began to collapse like foam.

The boy looked at Su Yuqing, giving a strange smile. "Do… you understand…"

The boy's voice disappeared, and everything around him vanished. Before her eyes was only endless darkness, and Su Yuqing felt like she was falling into an abyss.

Then… she woke up.

A bright ray of sunlight shone through the gap in the curtains, showing faint dust motes floating in the room…

There were still traces of tears from her sleep on the pillow, a little wet, but almost dry.

Su Yuqing knew why she felt so cold last night—she only covered half her body with the blanket.

However, this wasn't her focus. She kept chewing on the boy's last words. She didn't understand what he meant.

Understand? Understand what?

The alarm clock broke Su Yuqing's thoughts. She impatiently turned it off, but found that the interruption had caused her to forget many things from the dream, not even knowing why the boy had said that to her. The only thing she remembered was his question.

Do you understand?

"Understand what…" Su Yuqing rubbed her temples in a headache.  In the end, she decided not to think about such complicated problems. It was just a dream after all.  Why bother?  Besides, dreams are illogical.  Overthinking is just a waste of energy.

Su Yuqing opened the curtains, more sunlight flooding in, instantly brightening the room. Outside the window, however, a "guest" was already waiting.

Cookie, all in black, gently wagged its tail, patiently waiting.  Coffee, however, seemed restless, jumping around Cookie.

Su Yuqing opened the window, letting Cookie and Coffee in.

"Good morning," Su Yuqing took a deep breath of the fresh air from outside, saying to Cookie and Coffee.

"Meow~"

"Squeak!"

Cookie and Coffee also greeted Su Yuqing in their own "language."

Su Yuqing didn't have anything to eat, so she simply filled a small disposable cup with cold boiled water and placed it in front of Cookie and Coffee.

"There's nothing else to eat, so please drink water."

Cookie didn't mind and gracefully lowered its head, gently licking the slightly cool water with its soft tongue.

Su Yuqing smiled softly and went to the bathroom to wash up.

She clearly felt her hair had become much finer, smoother, and softer than before. While happily imagining what it would look like when it grew to cover her ears, she hummed as she gently wiped her smooth face with a towel.

After washing up, it was 8:40. Leaving now, she would arrive at the noodle shop in about ten minutes.

Su Yuqing didn't like to cut things too close. If possible, she preferred to arrive early.

"I'm going out. What about you two?" Su Yuqing looked at Cookie and Coffee.

"Meow~" Cookie picked up Coffee, placed it on its back, then lightly and steadily jumped to the ground, softly meowing to Su Yuqing, as if wanting to go out with her.

"Huh? You're coming with me?" Su Yuqing asked in surprise.

"Meow~"

Su Yuqing opened her door and went out, seeing Cookie carrying Coffee also coming out.

It seemed they really intended to go out with Su Yuqing.

Su Yuqing walked in front, Cookie obediently followed behind, unhurried, perfectly embodying the elegance of a cat…

When they reached downstairs, Cookie didn't walk on the ground but nimbly jumped onto the wall, slowly following Su Yuqing.

"Cookie, are you going out for a walk?" Su Yuqing asked, knowing Cookie couldn't answer.

"Meow~" Cookie continued to meow softly, as if responding to Su Yuqing, or perhaps acting spoiled.

Su Yuqing felt exceptionally reassured. Although Cookie was just a cat, it made her feel like someone was accompanying her to work.

This feeling was really nice…

Without anyone, having a cat and a mouse wasn't so bad either.

For the first time, Su Yuqing felt the road to the noodle shop was so short. She quickly reached the noodle shop's entrance, and it was time to say goodbye to Cookie.

"Cookie… then we'll see… you later?"

"Meow…" Cookie didn't leave, and Su Yuqing walked into the shop in confusion, seeing it follow her in.

Could it be that it wanted to accompany Su Yuqing to work?

It turned out that Cookie did intend to do so. It simply curled up in a chair, holding Coffee tightly in its arms, perhaps afraid it would move around.

"Hey, Xiaqing, did you bring a cat? How… did this cat catch a mouse?"

…
