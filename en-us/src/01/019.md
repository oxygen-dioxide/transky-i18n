# 19 · First Holiday After Starting Work

Perhaps it was because she’d taken a shower, but Su Yuqing slept exceptionally well that night.  She did dream, but not those strange, unsettling ones, and by morning, they were gone.

“Click.” Su Yuqing casually turned off her alarm clock. It couldn’t be set to skip days; if it was set, it rang every day of the week.

“Ugh… I forgot to change the time…” Su Yuqing sleepily looked at the clock. It was only 5:20 AM.  She started her new 9 AM job, so there was no need to get up so early. 8:20 AM would be plenty of time.

Su Yuqing reset her alarm, lay in bed for a while, and, feeling no urge to sleep, got up.

The morning air was refreshing.  Since it was a day off, she felt no pressure.  A good night’s sleep left her feeling refreshed.

This was Su Yuqing's first holiday since moving out and starting work.  It was only one day a week, but she wanted to make the most of it.

Holidays were for relaxing; sleeping all day was fine. But today's weather was exceptionally clear; only a few wisps of white clouds dotted the bright blue sky.  The rising sun was already brilliant.

And it was only 5:30 AM.

It looked like it would be a beautiful day.

This was thanks to the small city's location. It was coastal, small, and had less pollution, resulting in excellent air quality.  Staying indoors on a day like this would be a shame.

“Perfect. I’ll explore other parts of the small city.  It’s a good way to familiarize myself with the area.”

Su Yuqing stretched, pulled back the curtains, and went to the bathroom to wash up.

The clothes she'd arrived in fit best, but they were still drying from last night, and her other clothes were all too large.  Before she left, she’d worried that the medication would increase her chest size; the looser clothes would help conceal her figure.

Though, her chest remained flat.

She wore a sleeveless men's undershirt, a long-sleeved shirt over it, and a light jacket.  On the bottom, she wore casual sweatpants and—naturally—her sneakers.

She only had one pair of shoes and hoped she wouldn’t wear them out before getting paid.

Though the weather was warming up, Su Yuqing preferred to dress warmly to avoid catching a cold.  Being alone, getting sick would be a big hassle.

Living alone had taught Su Yuqing the importance of self-care.

On her days off, she felt awkward mooching meals from the noodle shop. She had to manage her own food.

Luckily, she wasn’t hungry in the morning.  She decided against going out to eat but would carry some snacks. Walking was tiring, and snacks would be helpful.

The cool, yet gentle air brushed Su Yuqing’s face like a mother’s hand, warm and soft.

Having no sense of direction, Su Yuqing wasn’t familiar with the area and avoided straying too far.  Once on the street, she picked a direction and walked straight ahead.

That way, returning would be just as simple.

The streets ahead were unfamiliar, and the further she went, the emptier they became.

This section was new, perhaps only a few months old, and not yet fully connected. Few people walked here; no shops lined the streets, only shrubs and tall poplar trees.

“Rustle…” The wind gently stirred the leaves, whispering in Su Yuqing’s ears.

Besides that, there were birdsong and insect chirps. Occasionally, she heard a frog croaking from the river.

These were nature’s sounds, the most calming “music.”

Su Yuqing walked slowly, enjoying the tranquility. The deserted street gave her a strange feeling.

Perhaps because it was Monday, or because the road wasn't fully open, the only people she saw were two or three at the beginning.  Later, she was completely alone.

It felt like a world just for her.

Su Yuqing closed her eyes and imagined a small city with only her. She could do whatever she pleased, pick out expensive clothes, have anything she wanted…

And… enjoy the solitude.

Loneliness could be painful, but sometimes, it was the best anesthetic in this cruel world.

Fantasies were the same.

Perhaps only in solitude did such boundless fantasies arise?

Su Yuqing wasn’t very fit. After about a kilometer, her legs ached, and her feet, where blisters had almost healed, felt like they were reopening.

Luckily, she reached the end of the street.

A barrier blocked the road. Beyond it lay a paved road, and beyond that, a dusty dirt road.

This road ran alongside a reservoir.  The embankment was covered in lush green grass.

The grass was unruly but had a unique beauty.

The embankment wasn’t steep; one could stand or even lie on it without sliding down.

Sitting on this beautiful embankment, one could see the tender sunrise above and the clear lake below…

This was perfect for Su Yuqing, who needed a rest.

Su Yuqing carefully walked onto the embankment, found a clean spot, sat down, leaned back, and lay on the soft grass.

“So beautiful…”

The shimmering water gently rippled. A carp leaped high, then fell back with a splash, creating waves and ripples.

What constitutes the most beautiful scenery? Not the typical scenic areas, but places with few or no people…

Tourists, aside from ruining the beauty, did nothing.

Su Yuqing lived in Hangzhou, and had visited West Lake many times, but her impression was negative. She only saw countless crowds and litter amongst them.

Was that appreciating scenery?

Wouldn’t those tourists be disappointed?

Though they seemed happy, perhaps they didn’t go to West Lake for the scenery, but for the atmosphere?

…The atmosphere of following the crowd?

For Su Yuqing, this was a hundred, a thousand times more beautiful than West Lake…

Now, this beauty belonged only to Su Yuqing. She could enjoy it without interruption.

“Rustle… rustle…” Su Yuqing heard the sound of rustling grass, followed by a pair of legs entering her sight.

Su Yuqing quickly sat up; lying next to a stranger made her uneasy.

She looked up curiously, wondering who would come to this unlikely place.

As she looked up, he looked down at her.

To Su Yuqing’s surprise, this “stranger” was somewhat familiar—a regular at the noodle shop, a young man who called himself a “story writer.”

His hair was even more disheveled than yesterday, seemingly uncombed.

His beard was also several days' growth.

An unkempt man who didn't seem unclean.

This contradiction made Su Yuqing remember him.

The young man’s gaze was gentle.  He looked directly into Su Yuqing’s eyes, but she shyly averted her gaze, unsure of what to do with her hands.

“Ha… I didn’t expect such beautiful scenery here,” the unkempt young man sprawled beside Su Yuqing, arms behind his head, exclaiming, “It's like something from anime—a road with no one, a beautiful yet quiet scene…”

Su Yuqing covered her face, looking at the grass beside her, saying nothing.

She didn't know what to say, and although she knew him somewhat, he was still a stranger. A stranger lying beside her, with only the two of them…

It was naturally awkward.

“It has a meditative quality…” The unkempt man continued, oblivious, whether to Su Yuqing or to himself.

She didn’t expect such a seemingly mature and steady man to talk so much… Su Yuqing thought.

He wasn’t exactly a chatterbox, just… easygoing.

“Little girl,” the man turned to Su Yuqing, looking at her profile, “Aren’t you at work?  Isn’t today Monday?”

“…Mon…Monday…re…rest…” Su Yuqing stammered awkwardly.

Although she didn’t want to answer…

But he had spoken to her, so not replying would be rude.

…
