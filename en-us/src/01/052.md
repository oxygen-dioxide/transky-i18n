# 52. Zhang Sifan, Caught by Love

“Boss, two bowls of large-portion noodles, please.” A pleasant male voice came from the doorway. Unlike Mo Kong’s low, husky tone, his voice was crisp and languid, somewhat resembling Zhang Sifan’s male voice, but far more melodious.

Su Yuqing, having just finished balancing the accounts, stood up, stretched languidly, and turned her head to look…

Then she rubbed her eyes vigorously, suspecting a visual hallucination.

“Eh? Sisi… Sisi Jie?” Su Yuqing exclaimed in surprise.

“Um… Xiaoqing…” Zhang Sifan was dressed in women’s clothing. Unlike her usual bold, mature-woman style, today’s attire was gentle and cute, like a girl-next-door.

“Xiaoqing, do you know her?” Aunt Zhang asked.

“Um… yes…” Su Yuqing nodded lightly, looking at the young man beside Zhang Sifan, full of questions, but hesitant to ask directly who he was…

“Meow——” Cookie, curled up in a chair, stood up. It had been lying behind Zhang Sifan and the man.

“Wow, this cat is actually with a mouse,” the young man said with a surprised smile. His smile was charming, his voice elegant, yet Su Yuqing felt a subtle discomfort.

Cookie walked straight to Su Yuqing, leaped onto her lap, then glanced at Mo Kong, as if greeting an old acquaintance, before jumping onto Mo Kong’s lap.

“Hey, isn’t that the cat?”

“Which one?”

“The one we often see by the riverbank. Last time, it was with this grey mouse.”

“Eh? No wonder it’s so friendly with you…” Su Yuqing watched Cookie nuzzle against Mo Kong, feeling a slight pang of jealousy.

Cookie seemed to sense Su Yuqing’s “displeasure,” turning to lick her hand, as if appeasing her.

This eased Su Yuqing’s unease, and she found her earlier jealousy amusing.

The noodles were ready soon. Su Yuqing placed them before the pair, lingering beside Zhang Sifan to whisper, “Sisi Jie, who is he?”

“That… he’s… a friend of mine…” Zhang Sifan blushed, stammering.

Even Su Yuqing could see their close relationship.

A boyfriend?

This thought surprised her.  She looked at the man again.

Men who liked them were rare. Zhang Sifan had found one. Though Su Yuqing felt a subtle unease around the man, she envied Zhang Sifan’s luck.

“You’re Su Yuqing, right?” Unlike Zhang Sifan’s shyness, the young man was poised and composed.

“Um… yes…” Strangely, Su Yuqing felt no shyness towards the stranger.  A tension was present, but more akin to the pressure of a crisis…

He was handsome, a beautiful man, but with more masculinity than Zhang Sifan, somewhat resembling a Western heartthrob.

Compared to him, Mo Kong seemed ordinary.

“My name is Sun Hao. Nice to meet you.  As Sisi said, you’re adorable.” Sun Hao smiled, extending his hand towards Su Yuqing, as if to shake hands.

Su Yuqing hesitated before accepting. He clasped her hand, deliberately squeezing it.

Su Yuqing instinctively disliked him. He reminded her of the wealthy young masters at the grand banquets she’d attended— outwardly glamorous, secretly engaging in shady dealings.

It was inappropriate to judge a stranger this way, but Su Yuqing couldn’t help her repulsion.  She felt unsafe near him…

Perhaps it was prejudice. Maybe he was a good person?

As he was Zhang Sifan’s friend, Su Yuqing tried to avoid disliking him, though she certainly didn’t feel any fondness. Compared to Sun Hao, Mo Kong felt much safer.

Su Yuqing made an excuse to leave, noticing Sun Hao’s persistent gaze making her uneasy.

“You don’t seem to like that guy much,” Mo Kong whispered as Su Yuqing returned to her seat.

“Um… that’s true…”

“Hehe…”

“What?”

“Nothing. I just find it interesting.”

“What’s interesting about it?”

“For a novelist, many things are interesting.”

“…Okay.” Su Yuqing was speechless. After a moment, she curiously asked, “What’s the world like in the eyes of a novelist?”

“Everyone’s world is different. Novelists just have richer imaginations,” Mo Kong said, pointing to the vinegar bottle. “For example, this bottle of vinegar—it inspires a little story in my mind.”

“Eh? Even a bottle of vinegar can have a story?” Su Yuqing’s curiosity peaked. “Tell me.”

“Okay… after I finish this soup…” Mo Kong slurped his soup, wiped his mouth with his hand, ignoring the stain on his crisp suit, cleared his throat, and began to narrate slowly.

“With this bottle of vinegar, I imagine how it was poured, and the pourer’s mood…”

Su Yuqing, chin in hand, watched the bottle, listening intently.

“Sunlight poured into a small, ordinary noodle shop.  A warm breeze, carrying a faint intoxicating floral scent, swept through.  A few customers sat casually, eating noodles. A girl working there stood at a table; sunlight slanted across her face, revealing faint, downy hair…”

“Her hands were very white, a faint blue vein visible on her back.  There was a sense of fragility,” Mo Kong said, looking at Su Yuqing’s small hand.  She blushed and lowered her head.

“The girl carefully cut open a sachet of dark vinegar. A few drops of dark red liquid flowed out, dripping onto the table. She didn’t notice, her gaze fixed intently on the sachet as she carefully poured the vinegar into the bottle…”

“W-what are you looking at!” Su Yuqing “threatened,” blushing under Mo Kong’s gaze.  There was a hint of nervousness in her “threat.”

Her face flushed even redder.

“The dark red, translucent liquid filled the bottle.  The girl gently sealed it…” Mo Kong smiled, pointing to his vinegar bottle. “And that’s how this bottle of vinegar became what you see before you.”

“That’s not a story!” Su Yuqing protested.

“Why not?” Mo Kong looked at Su Yuqing’s side profile, teasing her. “Are you shy again?”

“No, I’m not!”

“Meow——” Cookie, thinking Su Yuqing and Mo Kong were arguing, meowed, as if trying to stop them.

“Okay, okay, my sweet little girl, I’m finished. I have to get back to work.”

“My name is Su Yuqing!”

“Okay, Xiaoqing, goodbye.” Mo Kong smiled, paid, and left the noodle shop.

Su Yuqing stared at his departing figure, feeling a sudden pang of loneliness.

“Meow.”

“Um… and you guys too…” Su Yuqing smiled, stroking Cookie’s head, a sense of comfort washing over her.

“Here, let me feed you.” Sun Hao held a mushroom to Zhang Sifan’s lips, his voice tender.

Zhang Sifan looked embarrassed, lowering her head, whispering, “I-I can do it myself…”

“Let me feed you.” Sun Hao smiled, his tone不容拒绝 (不容拒绝 -不容拒绝).

Zhang Sifan, unable to resist, opened her mouth, letting Sun Hao feed her the mushroom.

Su Yuqing felt no envy this time. She found it sickening, as if… affected…

But what if Mo Kong were feeding her?

“呸呸呸… What am I thinking…” Su Yuqing cupped her face, blushing.

Sun Hao finished quickly. He watched Zhang Sifan, his gaze doting, but to Su Yuqing, it seemed affected…

Even though she told herself not to judge by appearances, she couldn’t help but dislike him.

“Hao… wait for me outside… I…” Zhang Sifan looked at Su Yuqing, hesitant.

“Okay.” Sun Hao, sensing they needed to talk, went to the door.

“Sisi Jie, who exactly is he?”

“That… ahem…” Zhang Sifan wiped her mouth with a napkin, standing to whisper in Su Yuqing’s ear, “We met online.”

“Online?”

“Yeah, a novelist… who writes transformation stories.”

“Um… transformation stories?”

“Stories about men turning into women…” Zhang Sifan whispered. “You’ve probably read them, Xiaoqing…”

“A little… So, he’s also an author?”

“Yes…”

“He’s different,” Su Yuqing mumbled. If Mo Kong was reserved, Sun Hao was flamboyant— outwardly humble, yet with an inherent exuberance…

“Huh? What?”

“Nothing. So, you’re his reader?”

“Yes…”

…
