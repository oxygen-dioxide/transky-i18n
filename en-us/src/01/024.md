# 24 · Cookie

“Interesting little thing. Come find me again sometime.” After finishing her noodles, the young woman paid and said this, causing Su Yuqing to involuntarily shiver.

Her eyes…were rather dangerous.

As noon approached, the noodle shop became busy again. The sun was dazzling, and the temperature was naturally high. The noodle shop hadn't started using fans yet, so to stay cool, one could only hope for the occasional cross-breeze.

The unkempt young man didn't come for noodles today, but it wasn't surprising. Eating noodles every day would get tiresome, wouldn't it?  One needs to change things up occasionally. Still, for some reason, Su Yuqing felt a little regret…

Once work started, time flew by. Before she knew it, it was dark, and the number of customers slowly dwindled until closing time.

Nine o'clock in the evening was Su Yuqing's quitting time, but not the noodle shop's closing time.  The shop closed later—around 9:30 if business was slow, or even into the late night if it was busy.

“Mmm——” Su Yuqing stretched her arms wide, enjoying the night breeze.  When she arrived, it was sunny and bright; now, as she left, the moon hung high in the branches.

Because she did a lot of tray-carrying, her wrists ached terribly. She shook them vigorously to ease the pain.

“Home, home…”

The thought of her soft bed made Su Yuqing yawn. But first, she had to take a shower.

Spring was nice in many ways, but doing laundry was inconvenient… Unlike winter, when clothes were thick and could be worn for at least three days between washes. Spring was different.  One broke a sweat with the slightest movement, yet still had to wear many layers of clothing…

Su Yuqing, a bit of a neat freak, couldn't bear to wear clothes that had been sweaty.  Even her jackets and trousers needed washing…

Su Yuqing brought a newspaper home from the shop. Without a computer or phone, newspapers were her only source of fresh news.

“Mmm… tomorrow… heavy rain…” Su Yuqing tugged at her shirt, buttoning it up one by one.  “Mmm… looks like I can’t hang my clothes outside today…”

But if she couldn't hang her clothes on the outdoor clothes rack, where could she hang them?

Su Yuqing looked around her small room and couldn't find a place to hang clothes. Should she take down the curtain and use it?

Su Yuqing, with her mild obsessive-compulsive tendencies, wouldn't easily do something that destroyed the aesthetic…

“Mmm…” Su Yuqing's eyes lit up suddenly. She took down the wire wrapped around the clothes rack. It seemed to be for support, but removing it didn't seem to affect anything. She hung the wire on the door, tied it, and hung her washed clothes on it.

That would work…

“Hmm… and a basin.”

Su Yuqing’s hands were too weak to wring out her clothes completely.  Water always dripped, not much, but enough to be bothersome indoors. And spring was naturally humid.  If the floor was also wet, she’d probably be unable to sleep at night…

So, she got a basin to catch the drips.

There was always a solution to everything…

After finishing everything, it was quite late.

Su Yuqing squinted, feeling the breeze from outside, opened her diary, and started writing.

She didn't write every day; sometimes she was bored, sometimes she had a memorable experience.  It had become a habit. Not writing for a long time made her feel empty, as if something was missing.

Su Yuqing's small hand held the pen, writing smoothly.  Her delicate script was a pleasure to behold.

“Meow——” At that moment, a cat's meow came from outside, a familiar sound.

“Meow~” Su Yuqing didn’t look up; the meow came again. If it had sounded far away before, now it was close, as if right in front of her…

“Mmm…?” Su Yuqing suddenly looked up and saw a black cat with blue eyes quietly squatting outside her window, its side to her, as if looking at something.

The long, soft tail swayed gently.  Because Su Yuqing hadn't closed the window, the tail was inside.  She could reach out and grab the fluffy black tail.

The black cat seemed to notice Su Yuqing looking at it and turned its head, facing her. Its small, cute ears twitched slightly.

“Mmm… are you… the black cat from yesterday?” Su Yuqing asked uncertainly.  There were many similar cats; it wasn't unusual. She thought of the cat on the riverbank because this cat gave her the same feeling.

Smart, calm, agile, strong, especially at night, like a top assassin, appearing and disappearing without a trace.  Yet when it stopped, it felt gentle, despite the powerful strength it seemed to contain, ready to burst forth, yet completely restrained.

“Meow.” The black cat wagged its tail, turned, and boldly walked from the windowsill into Su Yuqing's room, quietly standing on her not-so-large desk.

“Meow… meow?” Su Yuqing called softly, mimicking a cat’s meow, like a tiny kitten learning to walk.

The black cat tilted its head, looking at Su Yuqing, seemingly not understanding what she meant.

“…Meow?” Communicating with a cat was better using “cat” language, even though Su Yuqing didn’t understand what the other was “saying,” nor what she herself was “saying”…

Su Yuqing reached out to touch the cat's head but feared angering it, getting bitten.  She just put her hand in front of the cat, leaving its actions up to it.

The black cat looked at Su Yuqing questioningly, then placed a paw on Su Yuqing's palm.  The fluffy, meaty paw tickled Su Yuqing's palm, making her close her hand.

“…”

“…”

The cat and girl gazed at each other, motionless.  After a moment of silence, Su Yuqing moved first.  She was bolder facing a cat than a stranger.  She gently held the cat's paw and swayed it, then swung it more widely.

The black cat, with only three paws on the ground, remained steady. It wasn’t agitated, even squinting its eyes, enjoying itself, letting Su Yuqing gently rock its paw.

After a while, Su Yuqing let go. Cats were temperamental. Although harmless now, it might get angry later.

The black cat continued to watch Su Yuqing, then strolled around the small table, its gaze settling on a bag of snacks Su Yuqing had left on the table.

“Want some?” Su Yuqing took out a bag of loose dried tofu and showed it to the cat.

The black cat sniffed it and backed away.

“Hmm… what about dried fish?” Su Yuqing opened a package and placed a small piece of dried fish, only the size of her fingernail, in front of the cat.

The black cat placed a paw on Su Yuqing's hand, approaching and nibbling the dried fish, gently licking Su Yuqing's finger when its mouth was near, signaling her to release the piece.

Su Yuqing gave the cat the rest of the small bag. The cat quietly ate it.

“Hmm… do you have an owner?” Su Yuqing asked, pondering whether to ask the cat or herself.

“Coming to my house, do you intend to live here?” Su Yuqing’s eyes lit up.  “Hmm… though I’m struggling now, I can definitely feed you, just by taking some kitchen scraps…”

The black cat, of course, couldn't understand Su Yuqing. It occasionally looked up at her, showing it was listening.

“If you plan to live here, you'll need a name…” Su Yuqing bit her finger, frowning.  “Hmm… what should I name you?”

“Little Black…? No… too common…”

“Night Moon?”

“Hmm… it’s pretty, but it feels like a name from a novel…”

It was unimaginable that the usually quiet Su Yuqing could talk so much to a cat.

Perhaps because the cat was the perfect listener; it couldn’t speak human language, so Su Yuqing could say anything to it…

“Hmm… the tips of your ears are a little brownish, kind of like the color of cookies…”

“How about… Cookie?” Su Yuqing asked excitedly, already deciding on the name.

The black cat licked the bag, licking up the last of the dried fish crumbs, and looked at Su Yuqing questioningly.

“Meow?”

“I mean, your name is Cookie now.  Do you like it?”

“Meow.” The cat didn’t show whether it liked it or not, simply meowing.

“Okay! Let me think, I’ll get you a bed…” Su Yuqing was about to get up when she saw “Cookie” lick its lips, cleaning up the remaining taste of dried fish, then gently walked onto the windowsill, leaped, and disappeared into the darkness.

“Indeed… was I being delusional…” Su Yuqing sighed.
