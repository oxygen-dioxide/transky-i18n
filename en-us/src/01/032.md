# 32 · I Really Want Someone to Keep Me Company

If this had happened during her school days, Su Yuqing would have definitely found ways to act spoiled to her parents and skip class. Even if she did go to class, she would probably just lie on her desk and sleep, and her teacher wouldn't care much if she knew she was sick.  But work was different.

Su Yuqing even forced herself to stay awake, somehow muddling through the day.

Walking felt like floating.  Besides being a little dazed and slow to react sometimes, the day actually went smoothly.  She didn't mess anything up. Even Su Yuqing herself thought it was a miracle.

"Whew… Although it's over, I don't even know how I got through it…" Su Yuqing said with a relieved smile. It was time to get off work, and her day was finally done. She could finally go home and get a good night's rest.  She just hoped she would recover tomorrow, otherwise she'd really have to buy some medicine…

"Xiaqing." Zhang Auntie called out to Su Yuqing, who was about to leave, handing her a box of cold medicine. "You've been coughing all day, you must have caught a cold. Take this cold medicine. There's half a box left. Take it according to the instructions, and you'll be fine soon."

"Thank you!" Su Yuqing said gratefully.

Although Su Yuqing felt her fever was more serious than a cold, the cold medicine could at least alleviate some of her symptoms. If the cold got better, maybe the fever would too.

"Get some rest tonight."

"Okay, I'm going home then."

"Go ahead." Zhang Auntie smiled and waved.

Su Yuqing had gone to work while sick. After a long day of work, her condition not only hadn't improved, but had actually worsened.  She just wanted to go home and fall asleep.

It seemed fine now, but she was just holding on.

She grabbed a quick dinner at the noodle shop.

As a patient, she shouldn't have eaten such a heavily seasoned noodle dish.  Congee would have been better, but she was living alone in a small city. Being able to have dinner was already good enough, let alone expecting someone to make her some congee at home.

If she were home, she would tell her mother she felt dizzy, and her mother would get out the cold medicine, fever reducer, and make her some light and delicious food.

Although Su Yuqing hadn't exerted herself much all day, she still worked up a sweat.  For someone with her cleanliness issues, going to bed without showering was unbearable, but showering meant washing clothes…

This pushed back her plans for an early night.

At home, she wouldn't have to worry about any of this.  She could just jump into a warm bath, change into pajamas, and go to bed.  She could leave the dirty clothes for her mother to handle.

Although she didn't want to admit it, Su Yuqing really missed home. She missed the warmth and comfort of her family…

However, her parents didn't approve of her, and even if she went back, she wouldn't be met with warmth and comfort.

When a family has a serious disagreement, especially about something important, then that home can no longer be called a "home."

"If only my parents could understand me…" Su Yuqing looked up at the shower head mounted high on the wall, letting the slightly cold water blur her vision. She didn't have the energy to heat up water for a shower.  Maybe her condition would worsen, but when her body was so uncomfortable, she couldn't care too much.

Being alone was hard.  She really wanted someone to keep her company, but that was just a fantasy.  She had to shoulder everything alone, no matter how uncomfortable it was…

Su Yuqing felt her eyes getting a little sore, she wanted to cry.

Perhaps she was already crying, but the tap water had soaked her face, making it hard to tell if she was actually crying…

"Life has so many difficulties.  Will it always be like this, with me alone, bearing it all…" Su Yuqing dried herself off, stood by the window, looking at the dark night, muttering to herself. Her eyes were somewhat desolate and lost. She couldn't see the road ahead, just like she couldn't see far into the darkness.

Even where the streetlights illuminated, it was hazy and blurry…

Su Yuqing suddenly had an impulse.

If she jumped from here, would she die?

Would there be nothing after death? Then there would be no more pain?

"No… that's wrong…" Su Yuqing suddenly came to her senses, taking a couple of steps back involuntarily. She was startled by her own terrifying thought. She had actually considered suicide…

This was almost impossible before.

Su Yuqing was a coward, and cowards fear death.  She would never, ever consider suicide, not even think about it. But today, she had…

The thought was too terrifying and crazy. Su Yuqing was afraid that she would become someone she didn't even recognize…

"That's not right… My future life will get better. Now I have food and shelter, it's just a little tiring being alone.  It's nothing. There's no discrimination from others, and no restrictions from my parents.  This free life, what's so bad about it… I need to be content… I need to be content…" Su Yuqing comforted herself, suppressing the crazy thought in her heart.  Her mood gradually calmed down.

Yes, she wouldn't be alone forever. Maybe someone would be willing to be her partner, to accompany her and take care of her…

Thinking of this, Su Yuqing thought of Mo Kong, with his slightly weathered appearance, and couldn't help blushing, shyly lowering her head.

Understanding physiology, she had of course watched a few educational short films.  Now, her mind was uncontrollably replaying them, and she couldn't help but fantasize about herself as the main character…

Su Yuqing thought her mental state today was really off, changing too rapidly.  One minute she had such a crazy thought, and the next she started to daydream…

Even she couldn't control her own thoughts.

Su Yuqing remembered her past self wouldn't have such large emotional fluctuations, especially this kind of laughing, crying, frowning, and blushing all at once…

Maybe it was because she wasn't feeling well today…

Su Yuqing tilted her head and thought for a while, but couldn't figure it out, finally attributing it to her illness.

She didn't forget her medication that night. After taking the progynova and spironolactone, Su Yuqing also took two cold pills, making her feel like a medicine bottle, taking three kinds of medicine a day…

"Hopefully, I'll feel better tomorrow." Su Yuqing muttered to herself, turned off the lights, and got into bed.

The soft blanket tightly wrapped Su Yuqing's body, rolling her up like an uncut sushi roll…

Perhaps it was the sedative effect of the cold medicine, or perhaps it was the exhaustion from the day plus lack of sleep, but as soon as she lay down, she fell asleep.

It wasn't too late, she could still hear Lao Hu and the others shouting while playing mahjong downstairs, and she could even vaguely hear moaning and panting from upstairs…

But none of this mattered to Su Yuqing, because a person lost in a dream cannot hear, or cannot clearly hear, the sounds from the outside world.

Su Yuqing felt like she was getting familiar with that dream. It was the same as last night. She stood at the park entrance, but unlike last night, the dream was daytime, although it was dusk, it was much better than the creepy darkness of the night.

What surprised her even more was that the black wall behind her had disappeared, replaced by a street that looked like the real world. There were people walking there, and even someone driving past the park entrance and driving off into the distance.

Su Yuqing stared blankly for a while, then carefully lifted her leg and took a step forward…

Su Yuqing was stopped by something. There was nothing blocking her physically, but she was blocked, as if there was an invisible pane of glass.

"I can't get through… never mind… I'll get out quickly… and get some sleep…" Even in her dream, Su Yuqing was so sleepy she couldn't help but yawn, swaying as she walked into the dilapidated park.

Strangely enough, even though there were so many people coming and going on the street, there was still no one in the park.

The setting sun slowly descended, and Su Yuqing's feet stepped into the park.

At that moment, the world collapsed.

It wasn't a collapse like foam, but like the end of the world. The ground began to sink, and a huge meteorite rushed towards them. The burning flames seemed to burn away all the evils of the world…

"Boom——!"

The whole street became chaotic.

Although Su Yuqing was scared, she was relatively calm because she knew it was a dream, while the pedestrians showed an unreal madness.

The pedestrians shouted "The end of the world!" and instead of running away, they began to harm their own kind.

A middle-aged man, who had just looked kind and easy to bully, suddenly grinned, picked up a brick, and smashed a young man with colorful hair to the ground.

Negative human nature suddenly erupted.

Fighting, arson… and even forcibly raping women on the street…

Everything became chaotic, and even space seemed distorted.

Even knowing it was a dream, Su Yuqing still hid in the park in fear.  Now, the deserted park seemed like the safest place.

Why were people so crazy? Was it because the end of the world had come, so they indulged in their final moments?

Su Yuqing didn't have much time to think, because the next second, a huge meteorite fell on her head…

Then… everything fell into darkness.

…
