# 17. Everyday Necessities Shopping

Su Yuqing hurriedly ran into the public restroom.  As she lifted her head, she saw a man standing at a urinal, who looked up and caught her eye.

Startled at the sight of a girl entering, he flinched, spilling urine onto his hand.

Su Yuqing, blushing, pulled her hat lower and quickly scurried into a stall, finally letting out a sigh of relief.

Every time she used the restroom, she had to use a stall; otherwise, she’d feel so awkward she wouldn’t know where to put her hands…

Because she was always going to the bathroom, she had to constantly drink water to replenish fluids. And because she was always drinking water, she had to go to the bathroom frequently…

It was almost a vicious cycle.  Unfortunately, due to her job, Su Yuqing couldn't go too often.  She only rushed to the restroom when she absolutely couldn't hold it any longer.  Even so, she went about every hour, which made the middle-aged man quite surprised.

Thankfully, her flyer distribution work went smoothly. After a busy day, Su Yuqing was drenched in sweat. Today's weather was relatively warm.

In spring, the sun sets later than in winter.

At 5 PM, the sun was at its strongest point of the day. Even the soft white clouds couldn't block its final glow; everything seemed bathed in the crimson hues of the setting sun…

This was also Su Yuqing's happiest moment of the day.

Because she received her wages from the middle-aged man—two hundred yuan.

In 2004, two hundred yuan could buy a lot of inexpensive things.  At a two-yuan store, she could buy a hundred items.

Even two-yuan items were of decent quality. Su Yuqing’s allowance wasn't small, but she often frequented two-yuan stores because she could buy so much with a little money.  For someone who loved shopping, it was incredibly satisfying.

Sometimes, with a bit of luck, she could find small treasures.  Of course, these were more expensive.

You wouldn’t think a two-yuan store only sold two-yuan items, would you?

“Xiaoqing, you’re tired today. Go home early. Tomorrow is Monday, your day off.”

“Oh… Right! Today is Sunday, March 7th, tomorrow is Monday, March 8th…” Su Yuqing nodded excitedly. Everyone loves a day off. “Wow! Thank you, Aunt Zhang!”

“Hehe… If you have any problems, come to Aunt. I’ll help you figure it out.”

“Okay~ Goodbye, Aunt Zhang~” Su Yuqing happily waved goodbye to Aunt Zhang, bouncing along with her two hundred yuan in her pocket. She was clearly very happy.

Naturally, today was a good day for Su Yuqing.  She earned two hundred yuan, got off work early, and had a day off tomorrow. This feeling was even better than summer vacation, especially the sense of accomplishment from earning her own pay…

With two hundred yuan in her pocket, Su Yuqing felt more confident.  She had planned to buy cheap things from the grocery store, but now that she had more money, she could buy better quality items. Durable goods were a form of saving money.

The supermarket had many promotions.  Su Yuqing only looked at discounted items—of course, only the ones she needed.

The supermarket was crowded, but everyone shopped independently. Even those in groups knew each other; no one paid special attention to Su Yuqing. At most, they might glance twice at a “girl” dressed in men’s clothing.

Su Yuqing liked the shopping environment of the supermarket. There was no boss watching her, and the spaciousness allowed her to feel comfortable.

This supermarket, “Da Run Fa,” was the largest in the small city.  It occupied three floors, and the entire building had five or six. The other floors were mostly restaurants, arcades, or KTVs…

In such a large supermarket, she could freely choose her items without feeling crowded even with many people.

Most importantly, it allowed Su Yuqing to completely relax, to stay as long as she wanted without worrying about the store owner getting impatient…

Su Yuqing thought about what she wanted to buy while walking through the entire supermarket.

First, she bought an electric kettle, the kind that boils water when plugged in. It looked similar to a kettle that used fire.

It was very cheap, only twenty yuan on sale.  Comparatively, its functions were less advanced than those considered mid-to-high-end at the time—it only boiled water, and it didn't automatically turn off when it boiled.  Someone had to unplug it.

Su Yuqing’s home kettle automatically turned off after boiling.

With an electric kettle, she needed a thermos.  Thermoses weren’t expensive; although not on sale, they cost only eight yuan.  After all, it was a small city, and supermarket prices varied depending on location.

Then, Su Yuqing bought a light pink floral curtain, which was expensive at thirty-five yuan. This was mainly because it came with a wall-mounted bracket, allowing her to hang it anywhere with a wall—as long as she could fix it to the wall.

It wasn’t on sale.

Thirty-five yuan!  That was one-seventh of her two hundred yuan. It pained her, but thinking of how much nicer her bedroom would look with curtains, Su Yuqing gritted her teeth and bought it.

As long as she could afford it, Su Yuqing wanted things to be perfect…

In a way, people like her were mostly perfectionists. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have chosen this path because of the discrepancy between their body and their ideal self…

Besides these, she also bought a small clothes rack, a set of hangers, bath soap, laundry soap, and a scrubbing brush…

All the everyday necessities she couldn’t afford last time, totaling one hundred yuan. She finally had everything she needed and wouldn’t have to worry about being short of anything.

Su Yuqing mentally calculated the price of each item and how much money she had left, and what else she needed to buy…

Shopping was sometimes addictive.  Even after getting everything she needed, Su Yuqing couldn't resist wandering around the supermarket a bit longer.

She pushed her cart quietly into the clothing section, nervously glancing at the women's clothing on the racks, afraid of being noticed by enthusiastic sales staff.

Although she wore a hat and most people wouldn't know she was a boy, what if…? Wouldn’t that be embarrassing?

Besides, the supermarket’s clothing section had limited selection, and the prices were relatively high. For affordable, high-quality, and stylish clothes, it was best to go to clothing wholesale markets.

A few spring dresses looked pretty, but their prices made Su Yuqing flinch.  Each cost two to three hundred yuan, far beyond her budget.

Su Yuqing reluctantly left the clothing section, and then… she froze in the toy section.

At fifteen, she was a big girl, but still a child, always drawn to certain toys, always succumbing to temptation…

The reason adults aren't tempted by toys anymore is that there are more worthwhile things tempting them!

So, what captivated Su Yuqing?

Um… a set of domestic Barbie dolls.

Although the quality of these domestic dolls was extremely poor, they were cheap, varied, and came with gifts.

And the large "Sale" tag on the box made it impossible for Su Yuqing to look away.

Originally priced at two hundred and thirty yuan, the clearance price was only sixty-five…

The huge discount made Su Yuqing even more tempted.  This might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity…

For domestic products, the Barbie doll’s workmanship was excellent, with three outfits and various miniature furniture…

“Um…” Su Yuqing shyly looked around, hesitantly touching the large box. At fifteen, she was still a child but already felt ashamed about buying toys. At this age, buying toys made people seem childish…

But Su Yuqing couldn't resist the temptation. If she didn’t have the money, that would be one thing, but she had enough money to buy this domestic version of "Barbie"…

Just as ordinary boys like to play with "Transformers" or "racing cars," boys like Su Yuqing, with a girl's heart, loved these dolls for playing house, especially those with changeable clothes… They completely captured her heart!

In the end, Su Yuqing took the clearance Barbie doll and put it in her cart, intentionally placing it at the bottom to hide it from others.

Um… it felt like trying to deceive oneself.

Su Yuqing calculated her remaining money and went to the bulk snacks section downstairs to buy some snacks for when she felt bored at home. Besides the “cute” toys, snacks were also a girl's favorite.

It wasn't limited to sweets; Su Yuqing also loved dried tofu and chicken feet.

A boy with an almost pure girl's heart—this is why she is referred to as "she" and not "he."
