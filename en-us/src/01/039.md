# 39 · The Stone Sword

Zhang Sifan, though not kneeling like Su Yuqing, clasped her hands and silently recited a few calming Buddhist chants.  She didn't make any wishes, only murmured a few lines about Buddha's blessings before lifting her head.

“Speaking of, I’m not a Buddhist, so will this even work?”

“Buddhism isn’t like Christianity; you don’t have to be a believer to ask for blessings,” Su Yuqing said with a smile.  “Sincerity is key.”

“But, don’t you hope your parents will accept you? Did the Buddha grant you a blessing?”

“Um… well… that’s… a trial… after overcoming trials… good things will definitely happen.” Su Yuqing started hesitantly, but her voice grew firm by the end.

“After trials, good things will definitely happen? Will good people always go to Buddha’s Pure Land?  None of that actually exists…” Zhang Sifan sighed, as if to herself, or perhaps questioning Su Yuqing.

Su Yuqing bit her lip. She wasn't angry at Zhang Sifan's words; perhaps, even she herself didn’t believe in those things very much.

“A comfort for the soul…” Su Yuqing also sighed softly, answering Zhang Sifan’s question.

“Shall we go?”

“Yeah, let’s go.”

Su Yuqing took one last look at the Buddha statue, its face now blurred and indistinct.  She vaguely felt it wasn’t any Buddha she’d ever seen before.  Could it not be a Buddha statue at all?

“Hey, wait.” Su Yuqing stopped. She pointed to a small door behind the statue. It should have been a hidden door, but years of disrepair had weakened it, making it noticeably different from the wall.

“What is it?”

“There’s a hidden door.”

“A hidden door?” Zhang Sifan looked in the direction Su Yuqing indicated, seeing the slightly swaying little door. “Hey? There’s a door here. I never knew.”

“Should we go in and see?”

“Sure.”

Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan pushed open the door.  There wasn't much beyond it – a small, cramped room, like a storage closet. But in the center of this “storage closet,” a stone sword was enshrined. Its carving style was similar to the statue outside; perhaps it was carved by the same person or group.

Because it was in this relatively enclosed room, the stone sword wasn't heavily worn.  Even the inscription on the blade was clearly legible.

It was written in Small Seal script: “Reincarnation.” Because these two characters are simple and resemble modern traditional Chinese characters, Zhang Sifan recognized them immediately.

Zhang Sifan liked reading historical books and had memorized many ancient characters, while Su Yuqing, whose maternal grandparents lived in Taiwan, could understand most traditional characters, so she recognized the words quickly as well.

“Reincarnation…?” Su Yuqing touched the indented inscription with a questioning hand. The uneven surface gave a sense of time's passage. “I remember only the Four Heavenly Kings in Buddhism use swords, but none use a sword called ‘Reincarnation’…”

“Maybe it’s a more obscure, lesser-known Buddhist figure.”

“Maybe. ‘Reincarnation’ does seem to fit the Buddhist naming style…”

Though carved from stone, the sword emanated a palpable killing aura.  It was hard to imagine how bloodthirsty the real “Reincarnation Sword” must have been, and how many lives its wielder had taken.

At the back of the small room was another door. Opening it revealed the temple’s outer corridor, running along the edge of the mountain. Though there was a wooden railing, looking down from there was dizzying.

“So… so… so high…” Su Yuqing, who had a fear of heights, stood so close to the mountain's edge, feeling like a slip would send her tumbling.  Her legs went weak.

The rest of Bailiu Mountain was a steep slope. Though high, it wasn't as shocking as this place, as this was a sheer cliff.  It was a ninety-degree drop.  Imagine standing on top of a hundred-story building and looking down; that’s roughly how it felt…

Su Yuqing instinctively grabbed Zhang Sifan's arm, trembling slightly.

Zhang Sifan watched Su Yuqing, clinging to her like a frightened kitten, and couldn't help but pull her into a hug.

“Waaaah—” Su Yuqing jumped, instantly panicked.

“Easy, easy, I’m not going to push you.” Zhang Sifan grinned, whispering in Su Yuqing's ear. “Xiaoqing, you’re so cute, like a little kitten~”

“Eh, eh?” Su Yuqing, with Zhang Sifan's breath on her ear, felt weak and her face flushed. Although Zhang Sifan was the same as her, at least he was dressed as a boy, and a pretty handsome one…

Su Yuqing pressed her legs together. The warmth made her incredibly shy.

“Okay, okay, since you’re so scared, let’s go down the mountain.”

“Mm…” Su Yuqing nodded awkwardly.

Going down might be easier on the body, but not necessarily simpler.  Descending required controlling the force with each step; too much force and you might roll down the slope…

They walked slowly, without resting.  Going downhill wasn't strenuous; if you controlled your steps, you could run. The cool wind on your face while running felt even better.

"Sis Si, where do you live?"

"Here?"

"Yes."

"In the suburbs."

"Not in the dorm?"

"Live in the dorm?  How could I… a lot of things would be seen."

"Mm, that's right…"

Though going downhill was less tiring, by the time they reached the bottom, their legs were numb and stiff.

“So tired…” Su Yuqing leaned on her knees, gasping for air.  A bus stop was nearby, empty.  No one would come to this place on a Monday.

“Much easier than going up.” Zhang Sifan pulled out a pack of wet wipes, handing one to Su Yuqing. “Wipe your sweat; it feels sticky.”

“Mm, thanks.”

“Don’t mention it.” Zhang Sifan waved a hand, slightly annoyed by Su Yuqing’s formality. “We’re best friends online; we’ll definitely be best friends in real life too.”

“Ah… mm…”

The bus ride from Bailiu Mountain to Zhang Sifan’s home wasn't very long.

Su Yuqing opened the window, squinting comfortably in the breeze. The plastic seats were hard, but still felt wonderfully comfortable. The slight swaying of the bus made Su Yuqing feel like she was back in her cradle as a child.

“Sis Si, do you live in a farmer’s house too?” Su Yuqing squinted, watching the scenery receding. The bus went further and further, the road became more desolate. Large fields and scattered houses dotted the landscape.

“No~” Zhang Sifan smiled mysteriously. “You’ll see when we get there.”

“Huh?  A regular apartment building?” Su Yuqing was curious.  But this whole area was rural; there shouldn't be any urban complexes.

The bus quickly reached the terminal. This terminal was completely different from the city’s.  The city terminal was surrounded by vendors and shops. This one was just a bus stop, an empty space surrounded by a concrete wall with a three-story building as the office, and only a grimy fast-food restaurant outside…

“Come on, Xiaoqing, we’ll take my e-bike.” Zhang Sifan grabbed Su Yuqing's hand and walked out of the somewhat desolate terminal, retrieving her e-bike from the parking area.

A Philips e-bike.  In this era, Philips e-bikes were synonymous with quality, durability, and affordability, making them very popular.

These e-bikes were somewhat motorcycle-like, more accurately electric motorcycles, capable of carrying two people easily.  Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan were small, so even three people could probably fit.

“Is Sis Si’s home far?”

“A little distance.” Zhang Sifan turned the handle. “Xiaoqing, hold on tight, don’t fall.”

“Mm…” Su Yuqing wrapped her arms around Zhang Sifan’s waist, pressing her face against his back, like a clingy, well-behaved kitten.

“Haha—Xiaoqing, don’t rub your face against my back, it’s itchy—” Zhang Sifan couldn't help laughing, his grip on the handlebars loosening slightly.

“Is… this okay?”

“Yes, yes, we’ll be there in about fifteen minutes; we’ll go fast~”

The e-bike sped down the village road. Farmers worked in the fields. Some early-planted seeds had sprouted, giving the fields a vibrant green hue.

The road got progressively worse.  Initially, it was paved, but later it was just a gravel road, jarringly bumpy. Su Yuqing felt her bottom going numb.

Soon, a meadow appeared ahead, behind which was a dense forest, or perhaps a small woodland would be more accurate.

There were no more fields, only a strangely shaped house built on the green grass.  It wasn’t so much a house as a collection of shipping containers.
