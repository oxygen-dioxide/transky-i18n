# 44 · Sharing a Bed

Even out in the suburbs, far from the city lights, the moon seemed larger, the stars more numerous.

Su Yuqing felt that the night on this grassy plain was even more beautiful than the day, perhaps because the darkness brought a unique sense of tranquility.

“Actually, I like the night,” Zhang Sifan said, sitting at the head of the bed, gazing up at the brilliant starlight.  “Especially those dark and windy nights.”

“Why?” Su Yuqing curled up in the blankets, delicate as a well-behaved kitten.

“Because the night conceals so much. It’s not like the bright daytime, where everything is so clearly illuminated. Sometimes, I feel like a bat, afraid of the light…”

Su Yuqing nodded, saying nothing.  She sometimes felt the same way, perhaps because the night offered better concealment.

Zhang Sifan's bedroom had excellent lighting, even at night. Looking up, one could see countless twinkling stars, their glimmer possessing a slightly hypnotic effect.

There were so many stars in the sky that even if one disappeared right before Su Yuqing's eyes, she probably wouldn't notice. The loss of a single star was insignificant in the vast expanse of the cosmos. The sky was so brilliant that the addition or subtraction of a star seemed to make no difference…

“We're like those shining stars in the sky, aren't we?” Su Yuqing asked thoughtfully.

“No…” Zhang Sifan shook her head. “We're the stars that don't shine, those whose birth and death go largely unnoticed…”

“…?”

“Because it's hard for us to reach the world of light. We can only hide in the darkness, and that’s the best protection for ourselves, isn’t it?”

Su Yuqing nodded, seemingly understanding but not fully grasping. She burrowed deeper into the blankets, whispering, “Sisi… close the window… it’s a little cold…”

“Okay…” The window closed, shutting out the faint chill that had been seeping in. The room, now slightly stuffy from the lack of ventilation, quickly warmed up.

“Let’s go to sleep… or we won’t be able to get up tomorrow…” Su Yuqing mumbled sleepily, adjusting her position and closing her eyes.

“Mm…”  A few minutes later, Zhang Sifan finally responded. She turned to look at Su Yuqing, but found her already asleep, breathing evenly, docile even in her dreams…

“Mmm… time to sleep…” Zhang Sifan murmured to herself, settling into the blankets.

She closed her eyes, then opened them again. For her, it was still early. She usually didn't go to bed until eleven or twelve, and with her occasional insomnia, she felt far from sleepy.

Zhang Sifan silently gazed at the twinkling stars, gradually feeling as though she were caught in a whirlpool called the Milky Way, slowly spinning, drifting along the river of time…

People often fantasize when they're quiet, and humans generally yearn for beauty, so those fantasies are often beautiful, even… things that are impossible to achieve in reality…

Zhang Sifan fantasized about telling her parents, not being rebuked, but instead receiving their understanding and support. Then she could pursue her dreams—earn money, get bottom surgery, find a loving boyfriend, emigrate to get married, adopt a child, and live a happy life…

Naturally, everything in her fantasy was beautiful. Unpleasant things were automatically filtered out. Such fantasies regulated her emotions, allowing her to achieve, in her imagination, what she couldn't in reality, fulfilling at least a small wish…

If a person lacked such beautiful fantasies, they might quickly develop depression. It was essential to hold onto those fragments of beauty.

“Mmph…” Su Yuqing shifted, wrapping her arm around Zhang Sifan’s, rubbing against her arm like a cute kitten. The bright moonlight gently fell on her face, casting a pure glow on her already delicate features.

Zhang Sifan looked at Su Yuqing’s slightly wrinkled nose, her slightly pouted lips—everything seemed so adorable that she couldn’t resist gently pinching her cheek.

Su Yuqing remained oblivious, still clinging to Zhang Sifan’s arm, rubbing her chubby baby face against her, murmuring indistinctly, “Mama…”

Zhang Sifan’s body trembled. Su Yuqing’s murmur felt both shy and stirred a latent maternal instinct within her.

Zhang Sifan gently stroked Su Yuqing’s head, softly saying, “Xiaoqing…”

“Mm…” Su Yuqing responded sleepily, her previously furrowed brows relaxing. It was as if a lost traveler had found a safe haven, filling Su Yuqing with a sense of security, the most peaceful and restful sleep she’d had in days.

Like lying in her own bed at home.

Su Yuqing dreamt she returned home, her mother not scolding her, but embracing her tearfully and smiling, her father looking at her with loving eyes.

Su Yuqing dreamed that her parents accepted her and decided to help her achieve her dreams…

Her mother hugged her, crying, telling her how worried she’d been, and that whether her child was a son or daughter, they would never drive her away, because she was their child…

It was a beautiful dream, so beautiful that Su Yuqing sensed its unreality, even as she reveled in it.

But she didn't want to leave this dream. If she could, she would stay there forever.

But dreams must end.  Awakening, the cold reality would have to be faced.

Su Yuqing awoke, despite her reluctance.  It wasn't due to any external influence, simply her body ending the dream, forcing her eyes open.

Su Yuqing stared at the ceiling, still savoring the dream.  She wished she could go back to sleep and immerse herself in it again…

“Mmm… awake?” Zhang Sifan asked sleepily, eyes closed.

“Mm, what time is it?” Su Yuqing asked.

“Let me see…” Zhang Sifan picked up her phone from the nightstand.  “7:10…”

“How long does it take to get to the noodle shop where I work?”

“Two hours…”

“Oh no!” Su Yuqing instantly woke up. If she didn’t leave, she’d be late.

This was her only job, one she’d worked hard to find. She couldn’t lose it.

“Sisi, get up, I’m going to be late for work!” Su Yuqing said urgently.

“Mm… okay…” Zhang Sifan understood Su Yuqing’s urgency. Although sleepy, she reluctantly got up.  “Xiaoqing, you go wash up, I’ll take you there, and I’ll wash up afterwards…”

“Okay!” Su Yuqing, without ceremony, rushed into the bathroom. Without a toothbrush, she rinsed her mouth several times. For washing her face, she used Zhang Sifan’s towel. Although quick, she spent seven or eight minutes before finally emerging, satisfied.

“Here, your clothes are dry, on the bed. Change into them. Put the dirty ones in that black bag and take them home. I’m giving them to you.”

“Really?!” Even in her haste, Su Yuqing was surprised.

“I promised yesterday. Don't be shy.  … Oh, you need to change… I’ll wash my face too…” Zhang Sifan, already in men’s clothing, walked into the bathroom, hair disheveled.

By the time Su Yuqing had changed and Zhang Sifan was ready, it was 7:30.

“Will we make it?” Su Yuqing was anxious.

“Um… probably… yes. Last time I didn’t drive as fast as I could. This time I’ll go faster.”

“Okay!”

“Xiaoqing, should you sit in the front or back?”

Su Yuqing shrugged and sat behind Zhang Sifan. “I don’t want to get cold.”

“Then sit in the back. Are you secure?”

“Yes.”

“Let’s go!” The heavy electric motorcycle sputtered to life and sped towards Su Yuqing’s workplace at about 50 kilometers per hour.

The motorcycle was stable and fast, not overly bumpy even at high speeds. Su Yuqing clung tightly to Zhang Sifan’s waist, anxiously watching the scenery whizzing by.

Yesterday it seemed fast, but today it felt slow.

Maybe it was just her feeling.

“Xiaoqing,” Zhang Sifan suddenly called out.

“Yes?”

“You smell like milk,” Zhang Sifan said, sniffing playfully.  “Very fragrant~”

“Hey, this isn’t the time for jokes…”

“Okay, okay, Xiaoqing is shy~” Zhang Sifan laughed, suddenly accelerating to full throttle. The motorcycle shot forward like an arrow.

The daytime Zhang Sifan and the nighttime Zhang Sifan seemed like two different people. Did Zhang Sifan have two personalities, one for day and one for night?
