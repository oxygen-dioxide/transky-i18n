# 38 · Mountaintop Scenery

Mount Bailiu was the highest peak in this mountain range. While it didn't even rank among the top one hundred highest mountains, it wasn't particularly low either.

Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan walked intermittently, resting more and more frequently as they ascended. Their initial rest came after covering at least one-fifth of the climb; the second, after half that distance. Eventually, they paused after every few steps.

Both were parched.  Su Yuqing had a bottle of water, but it was woefully inadequate for their strenuous climb.  And finding a store in the middle of this mountain range was out of the question.

Mount Bailiu had streams and springs, seemingly clear and pure. But as city dwellers, Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan hesitated to drink directly from them.  While the water was probably cleaner than tap water, sediment at the bottom gave them a psychological aversion, making it feel dirty.

“Almost… almost there…” Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan encouraged each other.

Their clothes were soaked with sweat.  The cold wind quickly dried them, leaving behind a crusty residue of salt that felt incredibly uncomfortable.

Su Yuqing used a thick branch as a cane, while Zhang Sifan was practically crawling on her hands and knees.

They could have easily avoided this ordeal by turning back at the beginning, but by now, the ascent was more than just reaching the summit; it carried deeper meaning, a struggle against their own lives…

“Finally… we made it—!”  Reaching the summit, Zhang Sifan felt immense pride and accomplishment. At the same time, the last of her strength drained away. She collapsed onto the grassy peak, sprawled out, gazing at the slightly dazzling sun and gasping for breath.

Su Yuqing struggled to the top, but unlike Zhang Sifan, didn't immediately lie down.  She used her "cane" to walk a few more steps before leaning against a large rock and slowly sat down.

“Ha… hu… I haven’t… climbed a mountain… in ages…” Zhang Sifan panted, addressing Su Yuqing. “The last time was over a year ago. I was in much better shape then; it wasn't this tiring.”

“The view from the top is beautiful.” Su Yuqing opened her bottle, shook it twice, and the last two drops slid from the bottom. Before she could drink, her dry lips absorbed them.

“So thirsty… I remember there’s a spring at the top. The water here must be clean.”  Zhang Sifan muttered to herself, rising shakily and walking to the edge of the summit. There, a small spring gurgled gently.

“Hey? Water?” Su Yuqing, ignoring her fatigue, joined Zhang Sifan, filled half her bottle from the spring, and drank greedily.

The water was clear and crisp, with a hint of fermented fruit… or was it a subtle alcoholic taste? Su Yuqing savored it, but the faint alcoholic scent vanished.  Maybe it was an illusion.

Zhang Sifan was quite slender.  Her somewhat oversized menswear didn't reveal it, but her wet clothes clung to her body, accentuating her physique.

Her shoulders were noticeably narrower than an average man's, her arms and legs thin, and her chest slightly rounded…

“Xiaoqing, I really think you have the perfect loli figure, you know…” Su Yuqing looked at Zhang Sifan, who reciprocated the gaze, reaching out to touch Su Yuqing's thigh.  “Such slender legs… I wish I could swap bodies with you…”

“Sis’s body isn’t bad either.”

“Comparing ourselves is depressing…” Zhang Sifan shook her head, took several large gulps of spring water, then sat down next to the rock where Su Yuqing had been resting. “Let’s rest for a while…”

The feeling of reaching the summit was inexplicably exhilarating, like completing a major life event. If Su Yuqing ever achieved her dreams, her joy might surpass this feeling.

As the highest peak in the area, Mount Bailiu offered a unique view.  While not comparable to famous mountains, it held its own charm.

At least, looking down from Mount Bailiu, you wouldn’t see countless people swarming like ants. The mountain offered tranquility, unlike scenic spots overflowing with crowds and discarded trash.

Standing at the summit, it seemed like one could touch the clouds, pluck the sun, or drink the "sky-sea".

Below, clouds and mist swirled, making the lower mountains appear ethereal, as if this mountain range truly harbored hermits and even immortal gods.

Amidst the bustling world, nestled close to the city yet maintaining an air of proud solitude, Mount Bailiu was certainly unique.

The summit held more than just stunning scenery; a dilapidated, abandoned temple sat in the center, occupying roughly a quarter of the summit.  It sounded like a lot, but the summit wasn't particularly large; the temple itself only covered about a hundred square meters.

After resting for a while, Zhang Sifan pulled Su Yuqing to the temple.

“What god does this temple worship?” Su Yuqing asked, gazing at the decaying wooden door.

“Not a god, a Buddha… I don't know which one, probably Amitabha Buddha…”

“Why isn't it maintained by monks?”

“Such a small, dilapidated temple, perched atop a not-so-low mountain.  It takes effort to get here; there’s no profit, so no one maintains it.”

“I mean monks.”

“Exactly, monks.” Zhang Sifan said confidently. “Xiaoqing, do you really think the monks in temples today are true monks?  Frankly, most large temples are special scenic areas. Monks are just ‘businessmen’ selling ‘faith,’ just in a different way.”

“Huh?”

“And modern monks have no monastic rules. I’ve even seen monks driving sports cars with women.  Nothing special.”

“…Are there no real monks left?”

“Maybe, but certainly not many. And most aren't in famous temples.” Zhang Sifan scoffed.  “Most so-called monks and abbots are just special staff…”

“…That’s impossible…” Su Yuqing felt her worldview crumbling. Her family were devout Buddhists, including herself. Family influence had instilled a sincere faith in her. “…impossible…?”

“Nothing’s impossible. It's an open secret.” Zhang Sifan patted Su Yuqing’s shoulder, sighing softly. “You'll understand later…”

“It’s just the believers’ problem, not the Buddha’s.” Su Yuqing’s voice held a touch of piety.

“Alright, alright. Let's go inside.”

“Sis, what do you believe in?”

“Me? Nothing.  A bunch of charlatans…” Zhang Sifan quickly glanced at Su Yuqing. “Um… that is, I…”

“It’s okay, I understand.” Su Yuqing smiled gently. “Although I’m a believer, I’m not a fanatic.”

“That’s good.” Zhang Sifan breathed a sigh of relief. “Dealing with religious fanatics is tiring…”

They cautiously pushed open the door, afraid it might collapse.  Thankfully, despite its decay and cobwebs, it held, swaying slightly and shedding some dust.

The temple was tiny, with only a central Buddha statue.  A sandalwood altar stood before it, devoid of incense, only cold ash. Though dusty, signs showed occasional visitors.

Scattered cushions were disorderly placed. Su Yuqing carefully dusted them and neatly stacked them.

Afterwards, she devoutly bowed before the statue—its face so eroded that its identity was unclear.

Zhang Sifan watched as Su Yuqing silently chanted a short sutra, and curiously asked: “Xiaoqing, what did you chant?”

Su Yuqing didn’t answer immediately. After finishing the incantation, she whispered a few personal words, then stood up and replied: “A purification mantra.”

“Purification mantra?”

“Yes, Sis. Want to try? Make a wish to the Buddha.”

“Will it work?” Zhang Sifan asked with a hint of mockery.

“If your heart is sincere.” Su Yuqing’s expression was serious.

Zhang Sifan hesitated. She thought of her wish, then looked at the Buddha statue. Perhaps a spiritual anchor would be good.

“That… uh… the purification mantra, how does it go?”

“Namo Saddharma Pundarika Sutra, Samyak Sambuddha, Kutilin, Dazhi Tuo, An, Zheli Zhulisi, Zhunti, Savaha…”

“Is that the pronunciation?”

“Yes.”
