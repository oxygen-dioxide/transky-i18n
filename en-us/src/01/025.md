# 25 · A Dream Without Answers

They say, "What you think of by day, you dream of by night."  It's a bit cliché, but dreams, generally speaking, are just that.

They're products of the human mind's own mental activity, a kind of "fantasy" and "illusion" that occurs when the brain isn't fully awake during sleep.

This fantasy is actually similar to thinking about things during waking hours, only it's not as clear, since dreams are, after all, unconscious.

But undeniably, dreams can sometimes reflect a person's psychological state, it's just that many people don't understand what their dreams are trying to tell them.

Generally, a person has many dreams in a night, and almost all of them are forgotten by the next morning.  Even if some are remembered, they're usually the ones from just before waking, and unless recorded, these too quickly fade from memory.

Besides these fleeting dreams, there are those that repeat. Not only are the scenes identical, but the events are exactly the same.  Even when awake, the dreamer can clearly recall the events of the dream…

In many people's eyes, such dreams are like parables, foreshadowing things to come.

Another theory is that when a person focuses intensely on something, they'll have dreams with recurring plots.

Like how students preparing for the Gaokao often dream of sitting in the exam hall taking the test in the nights leading up to it.

And Su Yuqing once again found herself in this dream.

A pale crescent moon hung in the sky, veiled by faint clouds, barely visible.  No other stars were to be seen; the entire sky was mostly dark.

The streetlights were dim, flickering occasionally, spitting sparks, as if the power supply was unstable.

Every time she came here, Su Yuqing stood at the entrance of this park, looking back at the perpetually black expanse, with only the park as an accessible space.

Like a scene in a game, only the areas designed for gameplay were accessible; the rest was blocked by invisible walls. Even if other scenery was visible, it was unreachable due to these barriers.

Su Yuqing didn't know how big the park was, because she could only enter through that gate and couldn’t walk around it to measure its perimeter.

Stepping into the park, she heard the creaking of rusty swings, sounding distant, yet also like it emanated from her own heart.

Though slightly unsettling, Su Yuqing knew that place wasn't terrifying, and having been there twice already, she didn’t need to visit the little boy again.

The park was large; Su Yuqing might explore other areas, perhaps finding what or whom she sought.

So, Su Yuqing walked in the opposite direction.  There was less exercise equipment and fewer green spaces here. She saw patches of empty land separated into sections and a number of small pavilions.

This section seemed to be a small plaza within the park.

Wanting to gauge the park’s size, Su Yuqing walked straight in one direction.  The scenery changed little, and soon, she reached the end.

She saw the park wall. It wasn't very high, but looking out from it, she still saw nothing but darkness.

The wall wasn’t too high, nor too low. To climb over it required more than brute strength, needing some skill.

Sometimes, people shouldn't be bound by ingrained thinking. Perhaps climbing over this wall would allow her to leave this dreamscape or find the answers she sought.

Su Yuqing was tempted.  She looked around and finally found a concave section of the wall. Using a sturdy tree planted beside the wall, she climbed, grabbed the top of the wall, placed her foot on the indentation, and then sat on the wall, like sitting on a chair, and repositioned herself. Facing outwards, she took a deep breath and lightly leaped down.

"Thud." That was the sound of Su Yuqing landing.  The space beyond the wall was dark, but at least it was solid ground…

Su Yuqing turned around and could still see the dim lights of the park, faintly hearing the creaking swings.  She took two steps forward, then turned again, only to find the lights gone, replaced by complete darkness, the sound of the swings silent.

And when Su Yuqing turned back…

She saw the park's rusty iron gate, ajar, leaving just enough space for a person to pass through.

"!?" Su Yuqing widened her eyes in surprise, turning to touch the darkness behind her. It felt like a wall blocked her, but no matter how she jumped, she couldn’t reach the “wall's” top.

Could it be that even escaping the park didn’t allow her to leave its confines?

“…Forget it…I’ll just find him.” Su Yuqing shook her head gently, abandoning her exploration.

This dream always made her sleep very soundly. If the alarm went off and she didn’t hear it, she’d be late for work.

Anyway, each time she saw the little boy, Su Yuqing always managed to leave this strange dream…

"Creak—creak—" Su Yuqing walked through the woods to a small, open space. The little boy was lowering his head, swinging on the swing, seemingly lost in thought.

“…” Su Yuqing stood silently before the boy. She sometimes wanted to understand who this boy was, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t recall—even though she felt a strong sense of familiarity.

And once she left the dream, or rather, if she didn't look at the boy's face, she couldn't even remember what he looked like…

"Sister…you’re here…" The little boy slowly raised his head, speaking weakly. His face was pale, and several large beads of sweat clung to his forehead.

A gust of cold wind swept past, causing Su Yuqing to feel an inexplicable fear, and the sweat on the boy's forehead was blown away.

"Whew…" The little boy gently swung, looking better than before. Looking at Su Yuqing, he asked, "Sister…are you…still looking for something you lost…"

"…I…I don't know what…I lost…" Su Yuqing said, her head aching. Each time she thought about it, a flash of insight would appear, like the answer itself, but Su Yuqing couldn’t grasp it…

"Um…Sister…try harder…you'll surely find it…" The little boy said, patting his pockets.  Su Yuqing thought he'd pull out a stone like last time, but instead, he produced a bag of colorful candies.

"…What’s this?"

"Candy…delicious candy…Sister, do you want some…"

Su Yuqing quickly shook her head. Who knew if these colorful things were candy or poison? Even in a dream, she remained cautious.

Seeing Su Yuqing refuse, the little boy said nothing. He took out a small red candy and put it in his mouth. He puffed out his cheeks, seeming to chew with great effort before finally swallowing it.

"Ugh!"  After swallowing, the boy lowered his head in pain, curling up on the swing. The swing, no longer pushed, slowed to a stop.

The boy looked miserable and pained, but he gritted his teeth, stifling any sounds. Soon, his clothes and hair were soaked with sweat.

After a while, his pain seemed to lessen. He raised his head, wiped the sweat from his face, and leaned weakly against the swing chain, gently rocking again.

"…Is this…poison?" Su Yuqing asked.

"…No…it's candy…" The little boy shook his head.

"Then why…are you so pained…"

"Only…eating it…I…will feel…less…pain…" The boy said in a broken voice. He looked extremely weak, as if he might faint at any moment.

"…?" Su Yuqing didn't understand.

"Heart…hurts…eating it…will…feel better…heart…doesn’t hurt…"

So, it was a candy that alleviated heartache but caused physical pain?

Su Yuqing stared at the little boy, his weak form, the familiar feeling intensifying. Something flashed in her mind, but like a nimble fish, she couldn't grasp it.  This feeling of the answer being just out of reach was incredibly frustrating.

"Flicker—flicker—" The streetlights around them flickered again, becoming erratic, the entire park bathed in intermittent light…

Su Yuqing knew the dream was ending. Although she didn't know what she’d seen meant, the dream always ended after she spent time with the little boy, and this time was no exception.

"See…you…again…Sis…"

Su Yuqing touched the hat she wore, even in her dream—the main reason the boy treated her as an older sister.

Looking at the blurry figure of the boy, she suddenly grasped that flash of insight, wanting to say something, but the dream ended.

And the flash of insight Su Yuqing had just caught vanished from her mind.

Remembering something and then forgetting it was far more agonizing than not remembering it in the first place.
