# 47 · An Ordinary Day

Su Yuqing was an easily satisfied person, so she didn't always dwell on sad things. She could always divert her attention with other things, and she could always see the beautiful side of those things.

Just like this torrential rain, although it made her feel a little stuffy, after the rain, it would sweep away the dust floating in the air, making the weather refreshing.

Actually, Su Yuqing didn't particularly dislike the rain; she just hated the kind of continuous rain that lasted for several days. That kind of rain would make one feel damp all over, even lying in bed felt a little humid.

But this torrential rain was different. It came quickly and went quickly, giving rise to a sense of heroism.

Su Yuqing simply opened the window, letting the wind carrying the rain blow into her room.

"Boom!" The thunder was like a horn. With each clap of thunder, a gust of wind would blow, causing the rain to slant somewhat.

The sky was pitch black, not a single star could be seen, nor the sun that should have been so brilliant. Apart from the ink-black rain, there was only the invisible but violent wind.

Everything in the world was covered by this thunderstorm, making the world seem purer, because those complex things had "disappeared," leaving only the pure "rain."

Cookie also tilted her head, squinting at the window. The wind rushed into the room, blowing her smooth fur into disarray.

Su Yuqing pulled out a sketchbook from the drawer. The difference between a sketchbook and an ordinary notebook was that it didn't have lines, but completely blank white paper.

The rainstorm was still raging. The cold raindrops fell on Su Yuqing's forehead, but they didn't make her frown. Instead, her eyes seemed even more tranquil.

Like a clear spring—frozen.

Su Yuqing took out a pencil. The tip of the pencil was broken. She carefully sharpened the pencil again. However, because she used a knife, it wasn't as sharp as a pencil sharpener, but rather somewhat blunt, and the lines left on the paper were relatively thick.

But she didn't mind. She continued to draw quietly on the paper. It was a sketch, a drawing of the world under the rainstorm. Although Su Yuqing wasn't good at sketching, she was able to depict the atmosphere—even though what she drew wasn't very similar to reality.

The violent rain and the quiet Su Yuqing formed a stark contrast. Even Cookie looked at Su Yuqing curiously, wondering what this strange human was doing.

Coffee, emboldened, crouched in front of the sketchbook, looking like a quiet spectator. Besides staring blankly, it didn't make any other movements.

Su Yuqing didn't shoo Coffee away, seeming to immerse her whole heart in it.

The raging wind outside, the crackling rainstorm, and the deafening thunder seemed to disappear, as if the window had been closed, and those sounds were isolated in the outside world.

Only the "click," "click" sound of the clock turning remained in the room.

Time flowed slowly, but for Su Yuqing, it was more like a moment.

When Su Yuqing put down her pen, the rain outside had stopped at some point. The ink-like dark clouds had also dispersed, and a ray of sunshine quietly peeked out from behind a soft white cloud.

The hour hand of the clock had pointed to eleven. Unknowingly, it was already noon.

Seeing Su Yuqing put down her pen, Coffee also raised its head and looked at her. Su Yuqing's eyes met Coffee's two small, black bean-like eyes. The latter immediately squeaked, not seeming afraid, but rather as if it was talking to Su Yuqing. However, Su Yuqing certainly wouldn't understand what it wanted to express.

The painting was a gray world. Dense raindrops were falling from the sky, and in the distance were some hazy and illusory buildings.

The overall tone of the painting was dark, perhaps because Su Yuqing had painted many places with a layer of gray.

However, it wasn't entirely dark. At the top of the painting, there was a blank space. This blank space was very eye-catching. Although nothing was painted there, one could tell at a glance that this blank space represented light, a little light in this dark world.

What kind of mood did Su Yuqing want to express with this painting? Perhaps even she herself didn't know. After all, some moods can be expressed through paintings but are difficult to describe in words.

At such times, one could feel the dryness of language, which was far less accurate and intuitive than the feeling conveyed by the painting.

"Rip." Su Yuqing tore off the paper and tucked it into her diary, then closed it and put it back in her drawer.

"Meow~" Cookie, who had been lying on the table, stood up. Its fur was already dry. Perhaps because it had taken a bath, it looked cleaner than usual today.

"Mm...The rain has stopped. Are you leaving?" Su Yuqing asked reluctantly.

"Meow." Cookie shook its ears, walked to Su Yuqing, and rubbed its head against her hand, probably like a human waving goodbye.

Then, Cookie stretched out a furry paw and patted Coffee. The latter understood and quickly jumped onto its back.

"Bye...remember to come and play often..."

"Meow!"

"Squeak~"

Su Yuqing smiled and waved goodbye to the strange cat and mouse.

Cookie went out of the window, looked back at Su Yuqing, then leaped down, landing gracefully on the ground after a few maneuvers, without much jostling for Coffee sitting on its back.

The air after the rain was exceptionally fresh, and the sun was even more brilliant. It seemed that the next half-day would be a good day. Would Cookie and Coffee find a comfortable patch of grass to sunbathe in?

Having a rare day off, Su Yuqing also had many things to do, such as cleaning, drying clothes...

After the rain stopped, the ground dried quickly. Su Yuqing hung all the clothes on the clothes rack outside to dry. Some clothes were air-dried indoors during the rain, and even when dry, they still had a slightly damp, musty smell. Putting them in the sun would eliminate these smells, and they would feel much more comfortable to wear.

"Hum hum hum~ hum hum hum~ hum hum hum~" Su Yuqing hummed a little tune while carefully wiping the floor with a rag, even under the bed, let alone the tables and cabinets.

Su Yuqing didn't dislike cleaning; she actually found it a happy thing because she could wipe away the dust and dirt, making the room look clean and bright, which made her feel comfortable. And all it took was some time and effort.

On her day off, Su Yuqing had plenty of time because she didn't have much entertainment, only reading and shopping occasionally, so she wasn't in a hurry to do anything else...

Su Yuqing's little nest wasn't very big. Even if she cleaned very carefully, it only took two or three hours. It was afternoon, the sunniest time of the day.

"Ugh—" Su Yuqing brought in the last piece of clothing, stretched her arms wide, and said to herself, "I'm all sweaty, I should take a bath!"

Different people live different lives; some are poor, some are rich. But rich people aren't necessarily happy, and poor people aren't necessarily depressed. Su Yuqing always tried her best to enjoy her life; even something as simple as taking a hot shower could make her feel happy.

Of course, some small things could also make her feel down.

Even though Su Yuqing tried to control her emotions, she was inevitably affected by the things around her.

Zhang Sifan said that she laughed when she wanted to laugh and cried when she wanted to cry, living freely. But Su Yuqing knew that it wasn't freedom; in fact, it was easy to be swayed by emotions...

Su Yuqing sighed softly, murmuring, "Forget it...Don't think about these worries...Just let it be..."

The bathroom was filled with steam, making Su Yuqing's reflection in the mirror somewhat hazy and blurry.

But one could still see the soft curves of Su Yuqing's body. It was clear that her figure had become fuller; of course, not fat, but with more feminine features. Her hips had also grown larger. Whenever Su Yuqing went to work, she had to stand up straight on purpose to hide the curves of her hips...

Perhaps it was puberty. Su Yuqing, under the influence of medication, was changing rapidly. Her small face, while still young and delicate, was clearly no longer the delicate look of a boy but the softness of a girl.

Other people taking medicine only redevelop once, but the effect is limited, unlike Su Yuqing who directly controlled estrogen during puberty, the effect was much more obvious.

"Speaking of which, the clothes Sis gave me last time...I haven't worn them again..." Su Yuqing blushed slightly and thought, "Maybe...I'll try them on later?"

Anyway, there was only Su Yuqing in the room. She could wear whatever she wanted. Wasn't this the kind of freedom Su Yuqing longed for?

After carefully wiping herself clean, Su Yuqing tiptoed out of the bathroom, opened the curtains, and returned to her "bedroom." Zhang Sifan's shrine maiden outfit was neatly folded in the furthest corner of the closet.

She took out the whole outfit and placed it on the bed, feeling a little excited and a little thrilled. Her small face was flushed, but it definitely wasn't shyness...

Perhaps, "expectation" would be a more appropriate description.

Putting on pure white panties, putting on the red and white shrine maiden outfit, putting on the skirt, then rolling up the white stockings, putting them on her feet, then slowly rolling them up, smoothing them out and putting them on...

"Knock knock, Su Yuqing, Su Yuqing?" Just as Su Yuqing was about to find a mirror to admire herself, the landlord "Tiger" 's voice came from outside the door.
