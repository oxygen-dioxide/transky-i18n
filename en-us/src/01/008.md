# 8 · Her Own Little Nest

“So, young man, how do you like this place?” Lao Hu, his arm casually draped over Su Yuqing’s shoulder, asked boisterously.

“Um…!” Su Yuqing nodded vigorously.

Actually, the moment she saw the room, she almost couldn’t move. Though it was tiny, it held immense significance for Su Yuqing.

Because this would be her own little nest, her own private space.  The closet, for instance, could be filled with her women’s clothing. She could shut the door and dress up without fear of her parents finding out…

It was a child’s yearning for freedom, a beautiful vision of an unconstrained life.

Even if the future might not be so bright, it didn’t stop Su Yuqing from dreaming of that beauty.

Many children search for a secret base when they’re young, maybe a large cardboard box, or an uninhabited alleyway…

At that age, children already crave their own private space, their own independence.

Their desire to grow up quickly is really a desire to escape their parents’ constraints…

Even after they grow up, they may long for the comfort of their parents’ protective wings.

“If you like it, sign the contract.  Minimum three months’ rent upfront. It's usually 300 yuan a month, but since the boss recommended you, I'll give you a break – 200 yuan a month.”

“Lao Hu, you rented to someone else for only 150 last time?”

“That person was different. His room didn't have a bathroom.”

“This kid is my recommendation, and she'll be working here.  So young and living alone, she's probably struggling financially. 150 yuan it is then, the room’s empty anyway,” the landlady interceded.

Su Yuqing watched quietly. If she were renting alone, she would have accepted the 200 yuan, as she wasn't good at bargaining.

“Fine, fine, 150 it is,” Lao Hu sighed. “Utilities are extra, I’ll collect monthly.”

“Um…but…that…I…I don’t have enough for three months…” Su Yuqing timidly looked up at Lao Hu, who was slightly taller than her, and whispered.

“Boss, your girl is pretty broke, huh?”

“Xiaoqing, how much rent can you afford?”

“One…one month…”

“I'll cover the other 300. But that means no salary this month. Is that okay?”

“Thank you!”

Su Yuqing was immensely grateful to the landlady.  Right now, she felt that this kind landlady was even kinder than her parents…

With the landlady’s help, Su Yuqing successfully completed the contract and paid three months' rent.  Now she only had a little over a hundred yuan left, and considering next month's utilities, she needed to be frugal.

Luckily, meals were provided at the landlady’s place, so survival wouldn’t be a problem.

Life was finally stabilizing. Though it would be tough, this self-reliant hardship felt happy.

“Alright, Xiaoqing, get settled.  Start work tomorrow at 6 a.m.”

“Okay!”

Lao Hu and the landlady left, leaving Su Yuqing alone in her small room.

Su Yuqing closed the door and flopped onto the bare wooden bed.

The bed was small; even alone, a slight roll could send her tumbling to the floor.

But Su Yuqing was happy. She rolled to the left, then the right, reveling in the moment, feeling like the happiest person in the world.

This was Su Yuqing’s own little nest, where she could do whatever she wanted…

The seven or eight square meter room was cramped, but Su Yuqing found it just right. A larger room would feel empty; this snugness wouldn't be lonely.

After rolling enough, Su Yuqing sat at the desk, savoring the feeling.

The setting sun cast its last rays through the window onto the slightly damaged desk. Su Yuqing squinted, enjoying the day's final warmth.

Then would come the long, cold night.

As the sun completely set, Su Yuqing’s excitement about her independent life calmed.  It was time to furnish her nest.

Su Yuqing opened her suitcase, overflowing with belongings – not just clothes, but treasured items, like her little plush cat.

She took everything out, sorting and arranging them on the bare bed.

Underwear with underwear, shirts with shirts, pants with pants…

Su Yuqing carefully folded each item before placing it neatly in the clean closet.

Lao Hu seemed to have a slight cleanliness obsession, because though the room was unoccupied, she probably cleaned occasionally. There was dust, but not much.  A quick wipe was enough.

Besides clothes, there was a thin blanket. Su Yuqing spread it on the bed; the comforter was too large and heavy to bring, so she’d have to buy one.

“I wonder if there are any cheap comforters nearby…” she muttered as she made her bed.

Spring nights were still chilly, and Su Yuqing didn’t want another freezing night.

The bedsheet was plain with a light pink floral pattern. The simple room instantly felt warmer.

Su Yuqing placed the Cheese Cat plush toy on the bedside, then brought out more items.

A wooden pen holder she loved sat on the desk, along with a few cute cartoon figurines – crudely made, but beloved.

Also, a thick notebook – Su Yuqing’s diary, already filled with pages of writing.

In moments of emptiness, reading her diary felt like conversing with her past self, easing her loneliness.

It was an essential item for Su Yuqing.

Her overflowing suitcase didn’t hold much when unpacked.

Just a few odds and ends:

A cute towel, a cookbook, a well-read novel, a collection of Lu Xun’s essays…

Few items, but scattered around the room, they created a cozy atmosphere.

The empty suitcase went under the bed, her backpack in the closet.

Finally finished, Su Yuqing stretched, contentedly smiling at her room.

“So nice…my own room…”

The satisfaction of independence dispelled many negative emotions.

“Life will get better…yes…it will!” Su Yuqing clenched her fists, her radiant smile making her look sunny and positive.

She took out her remaining money, carefully counting it: 149 yuan.  She folded 20 yuan into a small envelope for next month’s utilities.

That left 129 yuan.

“I’ll use 100 for supplies, and keep the 29 as petty cash…” she carefully budgeted.  Careful spending would prevent financial hardship.

Even with meals provided, she couldn’t spend all her money.

What if she got sick, had a fever, a stomachache…?  She’d need medicine.

Planning ahead showed Su Yuqing’s growth; the beginning of maturity…

Su Yuqing’s floor was concrete.  Even clean, it wasn't barefoot-friendly.  Every inch of space needed to be used.

“I wonder if they sell foam puzzle mats…Those would be nice on the floor…” she murmured, clutching her last hundred-yuan bill, and grabbed the key the landlord gave her, and headed out.

Yes, from now on, this was her home, hers alone.

The evening street was much busier than during the day, full of people heading home from work.

The shops were diverse; Su Yuqing easily found a bedding store.

Small-city prices were low; a 1.8-meter comforter suitable for spring or autumn only cost seventy yuan.

It was a typical small-town bedding shop.  Cheap, but the styles were outdated. Su Yuqing searched for a cute comforter, but found nothing.

“Young lady, have you found something you like?” The owner, cheerful after a sale, approached Su Yuqing.

“Um…are there…any cuter comforters…”
