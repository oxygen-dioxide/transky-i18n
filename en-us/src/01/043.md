# 43 · Zhang Sifan's Birthday

The larger the family, the more rules to follow, and the more complex and less straightforward the relationships between people become.  Open and covert struggles are basically constant.

Even in an ordinary family, siblings will have disputes, let alone an ancient family. Even if it's not huge, the main and branch lines combined have several hundred people. Just vying for the position of each generation's head of the family requires several rounds of open and secret battles. Family ruin and death are nothing; more serious "accidents" leading to death are not uncommon.

Every family is like a royal family.

Of course, not all families are harmonious, but they are still in the minority...

The larger the family, the harder it is for family members to get along.

Zhang Sifan looked at Su Yuqing, who was frowning, and though many questions filled her mind, she swallowed them down.

"Forget it, let's just have fun today," Zhang Sifan handed a bottle of cola to Su Yuqing, saying.

"Mm..."

As the sky gradually darkened, Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan were still eating, though Su Yuqing had slowed down, only taking a bite every now and then. Even Zhang Sifan, with her large appetite, wasn't eating as quickly.

"Gurgling..." The hot pot was bubbling, making a constant sound as food was stirred from the bottom, turning in the broth before sinking again.

The orange-red sunset cast its last rays, dyeing the distant lake with its color.

The wind blew, sometimes as gentle as a mother's touch, sometimes as fierce as a speeding car.  Whenever the wind howled, the trees in the forest swayed, leaves rubbing against each other, making a soft "rustling" sound. In addition to this, there were the distant croaking of frogs and the chirping of insects in the grass...

This was the music of nature.

"Burp..." Zhang Sifan burped, then shyly covered her mouth, awkwardly hiding the impolite sound.  "Ahem, I think I'm full..."

"Wow, you practically finished everything," Su Yuqing sincerely praised, pointing out that both the hot pot and the grill were nearly empty.

"It's nothing..." Zhang Sifan fanned herself, seemingly shy about Su Yuqing's "praise."

Su Yuqing had thought Zhang Sifan was the older sister type, not prone to shyness.  Unexpectedly, when she was shy, she was surprisingly cute?

"I should probably go back," Su Yuqing stood up, stretching her arms wide. "It's almost dark..."

"Huh...?  You're leaving already...?" Zhang Sifan hugged her knees, whispering sadly.

"...Although I really want to stay with you, but...I have to work tomorrow." Su Yuqing was also a little reluctant to leave.  It was rare to have a peer in real life to chat with, to talk about things she couldn't tell anyone else...

The feeling of being able to open her heart had been absent for a long time.  Releasing all the things bottled up inside was truly a joyful experience...

But life doesn't always go as planned.  Even if Su Yuqing wanted to stay, she had to go back for work tomorrow.  After all, it was her livelihood.  Without that job, she wouldn't be able to survive.  After all, this wasn't like living with her parents, where she could rely on them. In this small city, she had to rely on herself.

"Stay... a little longer with me..." Zhang Sifan whispered, as if pleading.

Like a puppy about to be abandoned by its owner, constantly rubbing against its owner, unwilling to leave.

Zhang Sifan's voice was soft, but it touched the softest part of Su Yuqing's heart. She also felt reluctant to leave just like that. Was she pitying Zhang Sifan? Perhaps, she was also pitying herself?

At this moment, Zhang Sifan seemed incredibly vulnerable. Perhaps the previous cheerfulness was just a mask called "strength"?

"Okay...let's sit a little longer..." Su Yuqing finally sat back down, picking up her drink and taking a few sips.  Because of the previous conversation, a sense of melancholy settled between them, and the atmosphere fell silent.

Neither of them spoke, but neither felt awkward.  Instead, they felt that this silence, savoring the slow passage of time, relaxed their minds and bodies.

Only when attention is focused on time does time seem to slow down.

Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan both hoped this moment would last forever, because neither of them wanted to be separated from the other.

Having found a companion in the vast sea of people, they naturally didn't want to leave easily.

The sunset gradually sank, the last rays of light in the sky disappeared.  There were no streetlights in this field, and after the sun went down, it immediately became dark.  Only a few lights could be seen twinkling in the distant houses. Sitting here, those lights felt incredibly far away.

Like hope that exists in the darkness, but is difficult to touch.

The night also broke the silence. Zhang Sifan smiled, took out a handheld flashlight, and turned on the small lamp on the back. The faint light enveloped the two of them, in this dark field, like a hazy barrier, a space belonging only to them.

"Actually... today is my birthday."

"Huh?"

"I haven't celebrated my birthday for several years.  A few years ago, my parents at least celebrated it with me, but for the past two years, it's just been me, celebrating alone..."

"..."

"Each birthday makes me feel closer to my dream, but at the same time, closer to that dark abyss. I don't know what the future holds... but I have to tell my parents about these things someday. I can only keep it hidden, one day at a time... but that day will eventually come..." Zhang Sifan sighed deeply, "I wish that day would never come..."

Su Yuqing looked into Zhang Sifan's eyes. Although the light was dim, she could vaguely see tears welling up in her eyes.

"A birthday alone must be lonely," Su Yuqing asked cautiously.

"Mm..."

"Then today, let me celebrate with you.  I'm sorry... I didn't prepare a birthday gift in advance..."

"It's okay, having someone to celebrate my birthday with makes me very happy." Zhang Sifan wiped her eyes with her sleeve, wiping away the tears that threatened to fall, forcing a smile.  "I prepared a birthday cake, though."

"Huh?"

Zhang Sifan went into the room's refrigerator and took out a boxed cake, placing it on the small table outside.

Untieing the ribbon, the box opened.

The cake was small but exquisitely made. A cream mouse sat atop the cake, adorned with a few pretty little flowers. A circle of chocolate surrounded the cake's edge, making it look incredibly tempting.

"Did Sis Si order it?"

"Yeah, you were coming today, so I ordered a cake in advance. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to finish it by myself."

"But I can't eat much either..." Su Yuqing touched her flat stomach. She really didn't have much of an appetite; after all, she had already eaten a lot.

"Eat a little!" Zhang Sifan said, reaching for a knife to cut a piece.

"Hey hey! Wait!" Su Yuqing quickly stopped Zhang Sifan. "Sis Si, aren't you going to make a wish?"

"Oh... I forgot about the wish..." Zhang Sifan mumbled embarrassedly, taking out a pack of candles from a nearby box.

Su Yuqing stepped forward to help Zhang Sifan insert the candles into the cake.

"Sis Si is twenty, right?"

"Yeah, twenty..."

"Let me count... one, two, three, four... nineteen, twenty, perfect."

The number of candles must match the age.

This was Zhang Sifan's twentieth birthday, so twenty candles would do.

The candles were lit one by one. The handheld flashlight was turned off, and the entire field was lit only by the twenty candles emitting a warm glow.

"Happy birthday~ Happy birthday~" Su Yuqing softly sang the birthday song for Zhang Sifan, her sweet and melodious voice echoing in the field. Even the crickets and frogs seemed to keep time with Su Yuqing's song.

"Whew—" Zhang Sifan closed her eyes for a moment, presumably making her wish, before raising her head and blowing out all twenty candles in one breath.

"Happy birthday!" Su Yuqing clapped her hands, smiling. Although she was alone here, it felt lively and warm for Zhang Sifan at this moment.

"Mm...Thank you, Xiaoqing."

"...Mm?"

"Nothing, let's eat cake."

They certainly couldn't finish the cake. Su Yuqing could barely eat a small piece, finally washing it down with water. Zhang Sifan, although having a bigger appetite, had eaten so much earlier that her stomach was almost full, so she only ate one piece.

"We can put the rest in the fridge and have it for breakfast tomorrow, or lunch or dinner," Su Yuqing said.

"Mm, porridge and cake for breakfast, it tastes amazing."

"Ah, I've had it.  It's too sweet... isn't it bad to eat something so sweet in the morning?"

"Eating something sweet in the morning makes your day better."

"Mm!"

"Mm..."

"That...Sis Si...here's your clothes back, I have to go back..."

"...Stay here?"

"Huh?"

"I mean, stay with me for a night?"

"But...I have to work tomorrow..."

"Isn't it nine o'clock? I'll take you there on my scooter." Seeing Su Yuqing about to speak, Zhang Sifan quickly added, "Besides, your clothes aren't dry yet. You can't go back in this outfit! What if you're recognized? I have a hair dryer here. After drying, we'll hang it out to dry, it'll be dry by tomorrow morning. Even if it's not, I have an iron!"

"Okay...okay." Su Yuqing conceded.  Actually, she also wanted to stay here for the night.
