# 21. Black Cat

Perhaps God truly is kind, because if a fish doesn't become a bird, even if there's regret, it won't be too intense, and future life won't be so difficult.

But it can't be said that the devil is evil, because it only fulfilled the fish's wish.  The harm it suffered has no direct connection to the devil.

The fish, though transformed into a bird, besides the harm it suffered in its latter life, only soared in the sky for a few short minutes.

The remaining regrets far outweigh those it would have had by following the natural order…

A gentle breeze blew. Su Yuqing hugged her knees, burying her head low, almost touching her chest.

That inexplicable sadness in her heart couldn't be brushed away.

Where did that young man get this story? Or did he make it up himself?

If he made it up… his life must have been extraordinary.

Otherwise, how could he have such a profound understanding of life?

Time can smooth everything over, and complex emotions are among the most insignificant things it can smooth over.

Su Yuqing gradually calmed down.  She slowly raised her head, looking beside her, but the young man was gone.

On the vast green riverbank, only Su Yuqing remained. The scenery she had previously found enjoyable now felt incredibly lonely and cold…

She realized she hadn't even asked his name. What would his name be like? Memorable or ordinary?

Su Yuqing didn't know. Perhaps, she could only wait for their next encounter.

He should go back to the noodle shop for noodles, right?

A little anticipation stirred in her heart.

Maybe because in this unfamiliar city, he was the first person close to her age who spoke to her.

It was still early, the sun had only been up for a short time, and the city was gradually transitioning from quiet to bustling. Su Yuqing pulled out a small bag of dried tofu from her pocket, nibbling it slowly, looking at the surrounding scenery, lost in thought.

"Whoosh—" Just as Su Yuqing was thinking about the future, making plans for her life, a dark shadow darted from behind her, like a gust of wind, swiftly rushing into the river and diving in.

It was so fast that Su Yuqing didn't even see what it was. A black duck, perhaps, moving with unusual speed?

But judging by its size, it seemed rather small, not like a clumsy duck.

Soon, the shadow surfaced. It was a completely black cat. Unlike ordinary plump pet cats, its body was lean and streamlined, its swimming posture elegant. In a few strokes, it reached the shore, its mouth clutching a struggling grass carp.

The carp wasn't large, but about the size of the cat's head.  Holding the fish tightly, it quickly darted onto the riverbank, running to Su Yuqing's side—about a few meters away.

This black cat didn't seem afraid of people, nor worried about competing for food.  Dropping the live carp on the grass, it leisurely scratched its chin with its wet hind legs before tearing open the fish and gutting it.  Except for the beating heart, the rest of the innards were piled together, as if it greatly disliked them.

Although it was only a fish, the bloody scene still made Su Yuqing's heart pound, especially the gory sight, making her stomach churn, forcing her to turn her head away.

But the smell of blood still stimulated Su Yuqing's sense of smell.

Su Yuqing had seen her grandfather kill chickens back in her hometown.  The bloody scene gave her nightmares for two days, filled with terrifying scenes of carnage.

Witnessing the passing of those vibrant lives was too cruel for Su Yuqing, perhaps because her heart was too soft.

But people are contradictory.  While Su Yuqing disliked such "killing," she couldn't resist delicious meat…

Perhaps, that's human "hypocrisy."  Even when facing oneself, one can be "hypocritical."

The black cat ate most of the fish, picking only the tastiest parts.  After finishing, it neatly picked up the scraps and threw them back into the river, then jumped into the lake for a wash before slowly returning to the shore.

Cats generally hate water, even though they can swim.  Su Yuqing had never seen a cat like this one, unafraid of water, even actively swimming and bathing in the lake.

The washed cat shook its fur, leaving a large puddle of water on the bank, and then slowly walked back onto the riverbank.

Su Yuqing curiously watched the black cat, calm even when soaking wet.  She wanted to pet it, afraid of scaring it away.

Appearing unafraid of humans didn't mean it lacked alertness. Cats are quite clever.

Since that young man was gone, maybe having this black cat wasn't so bad?

Su Yuqing thought silently.

"Meow~" To Su Yuqing's surprise, the black cat greeted her, shaking its fur and approaching.

"Eh...?" Su Yuqing was surprised by the cat's initiative, and also delighted.  She reached out to pet the cat beside her.

The black cat subtly shifted, cleverly avoiding Su Yuqing's hand, lying down about a foot away.

Su Yuqing stared at the black cat, wondering what it meant.

The black cat looked at Su Yuqing, and after confirming she wouldn't reach out again, shifted its attention elsewhere, occasionally glancing at Su Yuqing, as if wary.

Su Yuqing understood.  It wanted to sit beside her but didn't want to be disturbed.

A cat with personality and quirks.

The black cat groomed its fur, and after it was neatly combed, it lazily lay on the ground, enjoying the warm sunshine.

Su Yuqing watched the black cat for a while, feeling sleepy—physical fatigue, but mostly mental exhaustion.

Su Yuqing had been tense these past few days. Even when sleeping, she reminded herself not to oversleep, to get up when the alarm rang…

She lay down on the soft grass, closing her eyes slightly, and fell asleep.

Su Yuqing dreamed she was the fish, striving to become a soaring eagle, only to be attacked by her former and future brethren…

She was battered and bruised, and fought back angrily, but suffered even more violent attacks.

In the end, she could only silently endure alone.

She had no companions, no kind, all her pain and suffering were hers alone…

At the end of the dream, she became an eagle, but lacked the strength to fly, lying softly on the beach, gazing at the boundless sky, losing her last bit of strength…

A furry paw woke Su Yuqing.  Opening her eyes, she found her face wet.  Tears had fallen sometime during her sleep. The dream was so real, so painfully real.

Thankfully, it was only a dream.

Su Yuqing sat up, realizing it was getting dark.  She had lain on the grass for most of the day. It was already dusk, the setting sun casting long shadows.

She regretted wasting her day off sleeping when she had planned to explore other places…

The black cat retracted its paw.  After a day in the sun, its fur was dry, fluffy and soft, not like a wild cat, but a well-cared-for house cat.

It was getting late, Su Yuqing should go home. She stood up, patted the grass behind her, and waved to the interesting black cat.  "Goodbye…"

The black cat licked its paw, stretched, its tail gently brushing the tender grass, squatting down, seeming to watch Su Yuqing, and also the distance.

Su Yuqing left the riverbank. Looking back, she saw the black cat still sitting there, as if seeing her off.

Today was International Women's Day, also a holiday for many couples.  Ordinary husbands offer a blessing, romantic ones a bouquet of flowers.

Of course, there are also children giving gifts to their mothers.

The streets were especially lively, nearby restaurants did better business than usual, and the busiest places were, of course, the flower shops.

While it's Women's Day, gifts aren't only for women. Some clever guys bought flowers for their girlfriends, hoping to one day make her their "woman."

Su Yuqing didn't know the exact meaning of Women's Day. Perhaps, it's a holiday for all adult women?

Most of the people lining up to buy flowers were men. Even if there were women, they were accompanied by men. There wasn't a single woman buying flowers alone.

On this holiday, women buying flowers alone were outliers, attracting strange looks.

Su Yuqing, in loose men's clothing, walked into the flower shop, looking at the fresh flowers, wanting to touch them. The owner's voice came.

"Little miss, what can I get for you?" Although strange, the owner wouldn't refuse customers.

Su Yuqing felt the strange gazes. She wanted to take off her hat to prove she was male, but gave up.

To be exact, it was a completely different path from the one Su Yuqing wanted to take. Once is enough, there will be more times like this, future judgments will be more numerous and cruel. Should she just give up?
