# 37 Â· A Pure Black Butterfly

Walking up the rugged mountain path, the ancient stone steps were covered with moss.  It was springtime, wildflowers blooming along the roadside. The combined scent of grass and flowers was exceptionally fresh, with a hint of morning dew and a touch of mint.

Perhaps on holidays, many people would come to Bailu Mountain to enjoy the spring scenery, but it was Monday.  Few people ever came to Bailu Mountain, and today, there was no one else.  But Su Yuqing and Zhang Sifan, walking among the mountains, didn't feel lonely.

A pure black butterfly fluttered up and down. Su Yuqing instinctively reached out to catch it, but the butterfly deftly evaded her.

"Such a beautiful butterfly... I've never seen such a beautiful butterfly before," Su Yuqing exclaimed, watching the butterfly that had dodged her hand but hadn't flown away. "Even when I went to Butterfly Valley in Taiwan, I didn't see a butterfly this beautiful..."

Some brightly colored butterflies boast three or four, or even more colors, and appear beautiful, yet their beauty is too flamboyant, their vibrant colors giving off a sense of threat.

This was the first time Su Yuqing had seen a butterfly that was completely black.  Even black butterflies usually have some other colored patterns; even without patterns, the color would vary in shade...

But this one was different. It was entirely black, a pure black without a single impurity or line. In the darkness of night, it would be indistinguishable from the night itself; even in daylight, it seemed like a tiny, flying fragment that had fallen from the night...

It felt like piecing together countless such butterflies would bring about the night itself...

Zhang Sifan showed little surprise at the butterfly. While not common, she had been to Bailu Mountain many times and seen this pure black butterfly before, so it didn't seem remarkable.

This black butterfly could only occasionally be seen on Bailu Mountain, a small "specialty" of the place.

"Xiaqing, you've been to Taiwan?"

"Mm-hmm... My grandmother's home is actually in Taiwan..."

"Is Taiwan fun?" Zhang Sifan asked curiously.  While she had been to several cities, all were in the Jiangnan region.  She'd never been overseas, not even to Hong Kong or Macau.

"Mm... it's okay.  The difference isn't that big, actually. Many cities in Taiwan are similar to small cities. The buildings are very old, but they aren't unprosperous.  Buildings aren't easily demolished or constructed. And the streets are very clean. To exaggerate a little, it's spotless."

"It sounds like a nice place... Taiwanese people must be very open-minded, right?"

"Eh?  Average...  No matter what, they're still Chinese. Even if they are open-minded, there are limits."

"Oh... really... I thought..."

"You thought they would accept people like us?" Su Yuqing finished Zhang Sifan's sentence with a smile.

"Yes..."

"Actually, it's okay. I think their attitude would be relatively gentler.  But I don't know, because when I went back before, I went back as a 'boy.'  At the very least, my cousins didn't treat me as an outcast because I looked like a girl."

"Eh, you have cousins?"

"They're my cousins."  Speaking of her cousins, Su Yuqing's expression relaxed. "We played together a lot when we were little. I remember we were once tricked into sneaking a peek at my cousin's shower."

"What happened after?"

"Well... of course, we got a beating from our parents..." Su Yuqing laughed foolishly, seeming to yearn for that life.  "My happiest times were at my grandmother's house when I was a child..."

"That's nice..."

"What about Sisi-jie?"

"I'm dressed as a boy now, don't call me Sisi-jie... Forget it, there's no one else here anyway..." Zhang Sifan mumbled. "My family is very ordinary... very ordinary... I can't say anything special about it, it's just like that."

"Mm..." Su Yuqing watched as the pure black butterfly gently landed on the back of her hand. The pure black butterfly formed a stark contrast with her fair skin, the two colors clashing so intensely it felt jarring.

"Sisi, what's your major?"

"Me? I'm majoring in computer science," Zhang Sifan touched her smooth chin. "I chose it purely because I thought computers were fun, and also, if I studied computer science, I could work from home. For someone like me, the less I have to appear outside, the better..."

"At least Sisi-jie you can go to university..." Su Yuqing sighed softly. "I might not even be able to finish high school."

"..." Zhang Sifan was silent.  She knew that for a child living alone, being able to support herself was already good enough, let alone going to school.  Moreover, Su Yuqing was only fifteen years old...

The path to the mountaintop wasn't steep, but it was long, winding around the mountain. After a few turns, Su Yuqing felt not only tired but also dizzy...

"Oof... oof..." Su Yuqing gasped for breath, her upper body bent almost to the steps.  She had to take several deep breaths almost every step.

Zhang Sifan wasn't much better, almost crawling on all fours.

"So... so tired... ha... oof..." Zhang Sifan's shirt was soaked with sweat.  She had already taken off her jacket and tied it around her waist.  After reaching a small platform, she could go no further.  Exhausted, she sat down on the steps, gasping for breath, taking off her yellow baseball cap to fan herself. Her hair was soaked with sweat, and a white mist could be seen rising slowly from her head...

Su Yuqing was already close to collapsing. Seeing Zhang Sifan rest, she didn't force herself and sat down as well.  At this point, she didn't care about getting dirty; it was more important to let her body rest...

Both of them panted like broken bellows, their breathing synchronized, which amused them. They looked at each other and laughed.

"Sisi-jie... you still have the energy to laugh?"

"So do you."

"Oof... I'm a little better... After all, there was a bit of physical fitness testing in school..."

"Oh... I remember in high school, I could get in the top three in the 1500-meter race in the school sports meet." Zhang Sifan looked up at the azure sky with a wistful expression, seemingly reminiscing.

"That means Sisi-jie must have been very healthy before?"

"Mm... I was on the physical training team before." Zhang Sifan squeezed her slender thigh.  "My legs used to be all muscle, but after taking the medicine, almost all of it disappeared.  Now there's practically none left."

"A lot of muscle?"

"A lot."  Speaking of her past, Zhang Sifan couldn't help but feel a little proud. "Before, I could climb this mountain in one go, up and down, and not feel tired at all."

"And now?"

"Cough... Of course not now." Zhang Sifan shook her head slightly, her eyes filled with uncertainty.  "Sometimes, I don't even know if my choice is right. The changes the medicine brought me in the direction of becoming a girl are far less than its side effects..."

"Sisi-jie, you can have surgery later, everything can be fixed."

"I know, but... making money is so hard... If I didn't have my parents, by the time I saved up that much money, I'd probably be old, right?"

"..." Su Yuqing fell silent. She hadn't considered that, because it was too early for her. Now that she thought about it, it was a real problem...

Moreover, compared to other difficulties, money was the easiest to solve...

The basic salary for adults in small cities was around 800 yuan, even if it was 1000 yuan, the surgery fee for bottom surgery alone was over 70,000. Even if Su Yuqing didn't eat or drink, she would have to save for almost ten years.  Even if Su Yuqing was only fifteen now, ten years later she would be twenty-five. It didn't seem late, but... that was without eating or drinking. If expenses were deducted, it might take more than twenty years to save that much money?

Thinking of this, Su Yuqing couldn't help but sigh softly. Many things can't be measured with money, but without money, most things couldn't be done...

Not even the threshold could be crossed.

"Sisi-jie, are we still climbing?" After resting for a while, Su Yuqing felt much better, her strength somewhat restored. But looking at the towering peak, she felt a little demotivated, because they had climbed only one-fifth of the way after so much hard work...

"Climb, why wouldn't we climb?" Zhang Sifan suddenly stood up from the steps, her eyes fixed on the summit of Bailu Mountain.  "If we can't even climb a small mountain, if we want to give up halfway, how can we achieve our dreams! Such perseverance is too weak!"

"But... can we really reach the top...?" Su Yuqing asked incredulously.

"How will we know if we don't try!" Zhang Sifan seemed to have figured something out, and immediately became "highly motivated."

"Is this a test of ourselves?"

"Mm, I suppose so." Zhang Sifan answered with a smile.

Thus, two people of the same kind, rarely meeting in this vast sea of people, helped each other and climbed towards the summit...

It felt like they weren't walking a mountain path, but the path of life.
