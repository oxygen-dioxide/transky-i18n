# 18. Subtle Bodily Changes

After buying all this, she had very little money left.  The two hundred yuan she’d earned today was almost entirely gone, thanks to Su Yuqing.

It made her sigh again; money disappears quickly, but it’s hard to earn.

She kind of regretted buying the Barbie doll.  Even though it was a high-end product among domestic ones, the craftsmanship was really subpar.  The face, especially, looked okay from afar, but up close, it was incredibly disappointing…

“Oh well… I already bought it…” Su Yuqing murmured to herself, a bit satisfied looking at the doll in its box.

To avoid attracting too much attention, Su Yuqing carefully put the large box into a bag. Under the cover of night, it was less noticeable, which made her feel a little safer…

Still, walking down the street like this felt a little awkward and shy.

Back home, Su Yuqing put the household goods in the cupboard, to be used later.

The curtain rod had to be installed first. Living alone was freeing, but it meant she had to do things like this herself.  Su Yuqing had to stand on a chair to fix the telescopic rod between the two walls.  It was adjustable, so length wasn't a worry, as long as it wasn't too short.

After getting the measurements right, she had to hammer in the nails…

It was definitely physical labor.  Even holding the hammer felt heavy, and then she had to hold the rod and hammer in the nails…

Several times, Su Yuqing almost gave up. How she wished someone could help her.

But she had to do it herself.  Sacrifice, sacrifice.  Sacrifice leads to gain.  It was the inevitable price.

At first, to secure it, Su Yuqing hammered several times in a row to get both sides firmly fixed. She paused to catch her breath, then picked up the heavy hammer and continued, hammering a few times before resting again. By the time the entire rod was firmly fixed, her hands were numb.  Even lifting the curtain was difficult.

Finally, she finished installing the curtain.  Su Yuqing was drenched in sweat, her clothes soaked as if she'd just run an 800-meter race.

The window by the desk was still open.  A gust of cool wind blew in, making Su Yuqing shiver.  That feeling of sweating and then being hit with cold wind… it was like being instantly frozen in a refrigerator…

For an ordinary boy, it might be comfortable, but for Su Yuqing, it was unbearable.

Shivering, she jumped off the chair, quickly closing the window and boiling water in the electric kettle.

No water heater, and no way to directly take a hot shower. Boiling water was the only option. As for a cold shower…

If Su Yuqing didn’t want to immediately get a 40-degree fever, she wouldn’t even try.

She knew her body wasn't strong to begin with, and after taking those medications with side effects, her health was only getting worse.  Maybe she should exercise more, some low-impact exercise, she couldn't remain this weak…

Su Yuqing didn’t want to become a muscular “girl”…

But, didn’t estrogen reduce muscle mass?

Maybe Su Yuqing had forgotten.

After a tiring day and a sweat-inducing workout, a hot shower was the most comfortable thing.  Even better would be a bath.

But this wasn’t Su Yuqing’s home, just a small rented room, lucky to even have a private bathroom. Su Yuqing could only make do with boiling water mixed with cold water.

It was spring, but not having showered for several days still made Su Yuqing uncomfortable. When her skin touched the warm water, she closed her eyes in bliss.

For someone with a bit of a clean freak personality, bathing was the most wonderful thing…

In the small bathroom, steam filled the air.  Su Yuqing was using a washcloth to scrub herself, while the electric kettle was still “gurgling,” indicating the next pot of water was almost ready.

“Woo—woo—” The boiling electric kettle started whistling, a slightly distorted sound in the steam-filled bathroom.

Su Yuqing unplugged the kettle and poured the basin of water over herself, rinsing away most of the evenly distributed bubbles.

Then she poured the water from the kettle into the basin and added cold water…

What do you like to do while showering, dear reader?

Girls might try standing to pee; boys might have a sudden urge to strike a “charming” pose in the mirror; and Su Yuqing…

Su Yuqing drew a big smiley face on the fogged-up mirror, added a few little figures, and then wiped them all away. The blurry mirror became clear again.

She looked at herself in the mirror. If you used the descriptions from a Mary Sue novel, it would be something like “skin as white as milk, cheeks as soft as a baby’s,” etc…

Compared to that, Su Yuqing was more concerned about the changes in her body.

The acne on her face wasn't getting worse, it was subsiding.  The large pimples had become much smaller. Soon they would disappear completely, and Su Yuqing’s forehead would be smooth and white again.

Su Yuqing looked at herself in the mirror, blinked, and made a funny face.  Something felt different, but she couldn't figure out what.

Were her pretty eyes more watery?  Su Yuqing preferred to believe it was a “special effect” of the steam…

Su Yuqing lowered her head, looking at her chest, still flat as ever, invisible in the mirror…

But, if you looked down from above, it seemed like there was a tiny curve, so small it felt like an illusion.

Su Yuqing gently poked her chest.  It felt more elastic, and a little firmer, as if something was starting to grow inside.

Her legs were still slender, but before, there had been some muscle.  Now, even that small amount seemed to have disappeared, leaving them rounder and smoother.

Her private area was hairless, a cute little worm hanging limp…

The steam rose again, blurring the glass.

Su Yuqing touched her reddened face, whether from the heat or shyness, she wasn’t sure. She gently scrubbed herself, a comfortable expression on her face…

Her body felt slightly hot, not from the hot water, but as if the heat was emanating from within…

Besides going back to her hometown, this was the first time Su Yuqing had washed like this, pouring hot and cold water into a basin. Even though she washed several times to get clean, it still didn't feel satisfying.

No bathtub, no shower head…

There was a shower head, but no hot water…

“Ah, whatever…” Not using the shower head or a bathtub, Su Yuqing felt she hadn’t washed thoroughly, even though she had. It was just her psychology, “Fine…”

Su Yuqing poured the last basin of clean hot water over herself, then carefully dried herself with a towel, and cautiously opened the door a crack.

Compared to the warm world of the bathroom, the room was incredibly cold. Even this tiny room was enough to make Su Yuqing shiver.

She stared, as if battling the cold wind, finally gritting her teeth and rushing out, pulling back the curtain and entering her small “bedroom” before diving into the bed.

“Whoa! So cold!” Su Yuqing hadn’t expected the bed to be even colder than the room.  Luckily, her body heat quickly warmed the bedding. Su Yuqing put on her clothes under the covers, then climbed back out.

Back home, she could have gone straight to bed after showering, but here, living alone, even after showering, there were other things to do.

Like… washing clothes.

Su Yuqing had washed clothes at home, but usually just a quick hand-wash before throwing them in the washing machine. The washing machine was so much cleaner and more convenient.

Even if they weren’t perfectly clean, her mother would always take care of it.

But now, it was different.  Su Yuqing had to do everything herself.  Even if she piled up mountains of laundry, no one would help her wash it; no matter how unclean her laundry was, no one would help her wash it…

Whenever she encountered these small difficulties, Su Yuqing would remember the good old days at home…

She would waver, she would yearn, she would regret…

But in the end, she refocused on the horizon, reaffirming her resolve.

Having already taken that step, how could she give up halfway?

So Su Yuqing took her clothes into the bathroom and began to wash them carefully.

The cold water from the tap was icy.

But Su Yuqing didn’t boil more water, because numb hands were bearable… She did this to save electricity…

Or maybe she wanted to toughen herself up.

But she was defeated by the cold reality.  The cold water made hand-washing impossible…

“I still have to boil water…”

With hot water added, it was much better. Su Yuqing washed them seven or eight times, making sure they were completely clean and odorless before hanging them up.

No one would do it for her, no one would care for her, help her, and cheer her on during difficult times…

Everything, she had to do herself.
