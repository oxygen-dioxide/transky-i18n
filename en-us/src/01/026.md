# 26 · The Shady Internet Cafe

Spring, a season of damp warmth and persistent rain.

After only two days of sunshine, the rain returned today, but unlike the constant downpour of the previous days, today's rain was intermittent.

Sometimes a sudden gust of wind would whip up, accompanied by lightning and thunder, followed by a heavy downpour.  The rain would quickly subside, turning into an overcast sky, sometimes even with the sun peeking through to dry the drenched ground…

Then the rain would start again.

In just one morning, there were three intermittent showers.  This on-again, off-again rain didn't feel like rain so much as sprinkling…

Or maybe it felt a bit like artificial rain.  Although, in a small city like this, artificial rain is probably rare.

The young man still hadn't come for noodles, as if he'd forgotten the place altogether.

Had he gone traveling again?  But hadn't he said he'd be staying in the small city for a while?

Su Yuqing watched the torrential rain outside, her chin resting on her hand, thinking silently.

The intermittent rain had driven away many customers. Su Yuqing was now quite free, and she suddenly found this idle time a bit tedious and boring.

She even thought of yesterday's "female wolf." If she came for noodles, it might be somewhat interesting…

Su Yuqing was startled by her own thought. Did she actually like being passive?  Being teased by a woman?

At this thought, Su Yuqing's face flushed, and she couldn't help but cough softly.

"Cough, cough!"

"Xiaoqing, what's wrong?  Are you catching a cold?" Aunt Zhang asked with concern. She was sitting at an empty table, watching TV.

"No, nothing…" Su Yuqing's face turned even redder.

Aunt Zhang knew Su Yuqing was quite introverted, and seeing that she was fine, she didn't ask further.

Su Yuqing's thoughts continued to wander.

When there's nothing to do, people tend to daydream, and Su Yuqing was no exception.

She thought of the day she was handing out flyers as the shop's看板娘, and the feeling of her fingertips lightly brushing against the young man's.  In that instant, her heart seemed to stop, and a flame seemed to surge through her body. It wasn't like this at school…

Even when her deskmate held her whole hand, it hadn't felt like this…

Speaking of her deskmate, more memories flooded back.

Su Yuqing's deskmate was one of the few boys who were kind to her, the only one in junior high school, actually. The other boys always looked at her strangely, as did the girls, who would often gossip about her appearance and personality behind her back.

Terms like "sissy," "neither male nor female," and "shemale," all with negative connotations, were thrown at Su Yuqing.

She had always been under immense pressure.  Luckily, she had her deskmate.  Without a true friend, life would have been much more painful.

Su Yuqing's deskmate was a delicate-looking boy. Unlike Su Yuqing, who leaned towards femininity, he was quite dashing. Anyone who saw him would think "handsome," not "pretty."

Many girls in the class liked him, but he seemed uninterested in them, and rarely interacted with them.

He was also very popular among the boys, because he was gentle and approachable.  Once you got to know him, you realized he was just an ordinary person, not pretentious at all.

He was especially attentive to Su Yuqing.  Because of him, she wasn't bullied too much in junior high.

Sometimes he would randomly compliment her, such as, "You're so cute," or "You really look like a girl," and would put his hand on her shoulder, making her blush.  Of course, more often than not, it was inexplicable.

Su Yuqing's deskmate would also find various excuses to play strange games with her, such as whoever loses has to hug the other, show their hands, or do cute poses…

He often played pranks, but never went too far.  If Su Yuqing got angry, he would apologize profusely—treating her to ice cream or something.

And every time, Su Yuqing was…well…bought off by his sincere apology.

Although Su Yuqing wasn't short of money, having a friend who genuinely cared for her was fun, so sometimes she would pretend to be angry to make her deskmate worry.

Perhaps, in a way, this was also Su Yuqing's way of seeking attention and a sense of belonging from her deskmate?

"Xiaoqing, could you help me…" Aunt Zhang said.

"Ah, coming!" Su Yuqing snapped out of her reverie, quickly standing up. She never refused the boss and the landlady's requests.

So although Su Yuqing was a bit physically weak, the boss and landlady would reduce her workload, making things easier for her because of her obedience.

"Wash and chop these scallions into pieces…"

"Okay."

Living alone, you really learn a lot. Although Su Yuqing had washed dishes at home before, she always did a sloppy job, requiring her mother to rewash them. Here, she could wash them quickly and cleanly.

As for washing the scallions, she had learned which parts to cut off and which to keep, and how to clean them quickly and efficiently…

It's just that Su Yuqing's knife skills were quite clumsy, and she was afraid of cutting herself, so she used scissors to chop the scallions.

The end result was the same anyway, so the process didn't matter.

It's just that scissors were definitely slower than a knife.

The day ended quickly. Because there weren't many customers, she was busy with other things, like cleaning, refilling condiment bottles, washing vegetables, washing dishes…

Su Yuqing stretched her back widely. She had a habit of stretching after work, as it meant the day's work was over, and she could rest properly.

"Whoosh…" The roll-up door behind her was pulled down. Because there wasn't much business today, the noodle shop closed early, so the boss and landlady could go home and rest early…

"Aunt Zhang, don't you live…in…that…tiger…um…my apartment building?" Su Yuqing curiously asked.  Logically, since she had recommended the apartment, they should live there too, but Su Yuqing had never seen them.

"Haha, we used to live there, but not anymore. We bought our own house on the street ahead," Aunt Zhang said with a smile. For those from rural areas, having a house in the city, even a small city, was something to be proud of.

"Oh… I see, goodbye then." Su Yuqing waved to Aunt Zhang, who sat on the back of Boss Li's electric bike.

"Goodbye, get some sleep early tonight, Xiaoqing."

"Mm."

Su Yuqing watched the boss and landlady speed away on their electric bike, but she didn't go home immediately. Instead, she changed direction and walked toward a small alley.

She'd heard from a junior high student who ate there that there was a shady internet cafe inside.

For Su Yuqing, who had a computer at home and used it almost every day, not touching a computer for a while made her feel itchy. It wasn't necessarily to play games, but maybe to check out new posts on the forums.

That's right, forums. In this era, forums still held considerable power.  As privately owned portals, there were all sorts of kinds, the most common being travel forums, military forums, and some game or anime forums. No matter what group you belonged to, you could always find your circle in the vast internet.

Even someone like Su Yuqing was no exception.

People like her had a small forum, and this forum was closed to outsiders. Only by successfully answering a set of questions or receiving an invitation from a forum member could you join.

Su Yuqing had a computer at home, and her parents were quite strict, so she had never been to a shady internet cafe. This was her first time.

Walking into the alley, turning a corner, she didn't see the internet cafe, only a small grocery store.  It was strange to have a grocery store in such a deserted place.

Su Yuqing looked behind her, realizing there were no more shops, and hesitantly walked into the grocery store, looking around. There was no sign of any computers…

Just then, a boy who looked about Su Yuqing's age pushed open a hidden door that blended seamlessly with the wall and came out, saying to the shopkeeper, "Boss, two more yuan."

"Which computer?"

"Number 13."

"Okay."

Su Yuqing watched curiously, feeling like she had entered an underground party headquarters during wartime.

"Um…Boss…are…are there any computers available?" Su Yuqing asked, blushing slightly.

"Yes, it's so late, not many people are playing."

"How much…?"

"One yuan and fifty cents an hour."

"Um…" Su Yuqing took two yuan from her pocket and handed it to the shopkeeper, saying, "One hour, please."

"Okay, choose a computer and let me know, I'll turn it on for you."

So, with a curious expression, Su Yuqing pushed open the hidden door and entered the shady internet cafe.

The environment was far from good, dirty and messy.  Empty snack bags were everywhere.  Perhaps because it was late, there were only three people in the internet cafe, and they all seemed older, perhaps nearly adults.

Only older kids had more free time. Younger kids rarely stayed up late in internet cafes.
