# 1 · The Escape

The sky was a bit gloomy, with light gray clouds obscuring the sky and the sun that should have been dazzling.

It was midday, yet it was as dark as dusk.

Su Yuqing lay on the bed, the various plush toys scattered haphazardly, some even fallen on the floor.

Usually, Su Yuqing was very careful with these plush toys; it was the first time they were left to fall on the ground like this.

A cold breeze blew in from the window, gently brushing his cheeks. He squinted, trying to see into the distance, but could only make out blurry outlines...

Su Yuqing gently touched the short hair that seemed freshly shaved on his head, a hint of resentment and fear in his eyes. He clenched his fist, and after a long time, as if losing all strength, he slowly let it drop and relax.

Su Yuqing was fifteen years old and would be starting his third year of junior high in the latter half of the year. Today was not a weekend; it should have been a school day, but he stayed home, with no parents to manage him. The whole house was quiet, only the sound of the wind whispering could be heard.

Su Yuqing had a delicate appearance. At fifteen, he hadn’t developed like other boys. He had no Adam's apple, nor had his voice changed. Although his height had increased, it was very slow. At fifteen, he was only 1.49 meters tall, making him one of the shortest, even among the girls in his class.

Even with his short hair, he looked more like a girl with short hair than a boy. Although there was some heroic spirit, it seemed more like a girl's dashing charm.

Or, perhaps, more like a tomboy.

Su Yuqing raised his hand, looking at his arm, tender and smooth, without a trace of muscle. His palm was small and slightly fleshy, making it look particularly adorable.

He kept his legs together, then suddenly sat up, as if having made a decision. He pulled out a large suitcase from under the bed. The suitcase was bright white, with cute Hello Kitty stickers on it.

Su Yuqing took out a pair of small, new shoes from their box and placed them in the suitcase. The shoes were small white sneakers, seemingly of a small size and a female design.

Indeed, they were women's shoes, because Su Yuqing’s size was only 35, and it wasn't easy to find men's shoes in this size.

The cold wind outside continued to blow gently, making Su Yuqing feel colder and colder. It wasn't a physical chill, but a coldness from his heart...

A piercing... coldness.

Su Yuqing quickly put a few sets of clothes, pants, and some necessities into the suitcase. After carefully checking that everything was in order, he reached out to close the suitcase.

But his hand didn't fully press down; it stopped in mid-air. Su Yuqing hesitated, glancing at the giant plush bear that was nearly a meter tall on the bed. He reached out to take it with him, but it was too large to fit in the suitcase.

Su Yuqing gritted his teeth and finally picked up the small plush cat doll next to the giant bear, stuffing it into the already crowded suitcase.

One suitcase wasn't enough; there were other things to pack.

Su Yuqing looked around and finally grabbed his schoolbag. He dumped all the books on the floor. The scattered books made Su Yuqing feel a little irritated. She (to make it more comfortable, let's use “she” to refer to him) kicked the troublesome books aside, then lifted the entire bed. In the cracks of the bed board, she stuffed over a dozen boxes of medicine, all unopened.

There were only two types of medicine, one called “progynova,” and the other called “spironolactone.”

When Su Yuqing saw that the medicines were still intact, she became a little emotional. Then, she impulsively stuffed all the medicines into her schoolbag, finally letting out a slight sigh of relief, as if her life depended on these medicines.

After finally packing everything she needed, Su Yuqing took one more look at her room, then dragged the suitcase and carried the schoolbag out. The living room was a little messy, showing signs of Su Yuqing’s struggle last night. Her previously hesitant eyes became firm again after seeing these “signs,” and a feeling called “resentment” filled her mind.

Su Yuqing walked to the door but didn't leave immediately. Instead, she returned to the bedroom to search.

Of course, not her bedroom, but her parents’ bedroom.

After searching for half an hour, Su Yuqing finally found where her parents kept money. In a small plastic bag, there were ten hundred-yuan bills, totaling one thousand yuan. In 2004, one thousand yuan was quite a sum of money.

Su Yuqing held the money, seeming to hesitate about how much to take, but when she thought about what happened last night, she stuffed the entire thousand yuan into her wallet and turned to leave the bedroom.

This time, she was really leaving.

Su Yuqing opened the door, and a gust of wind rushed into the room, making her clothes a little messy.

She squinted, her eyes struggling to open under the strong wind, but she could still see the road ahead.

Was she just going to leave like this?

Although they were very unreasonable... but no matter what, they were her parents who had raised her...

Should she leave... something behind?

Su Yuqing left a note and threw her house key on top of it, as if escaping, fleeing from the house. The door slammed shut with a "bang" in the wind, as if isolating one world from another.

The note lay quietly on the living room table, the handwriting scrawled, revealing despair and disappointment, just like Su Yuqing’s mood at the moment.

[Since you don’t acknowledge me, then I’ll leave.]

Su Yuqing ran down the road, wanting to get away from there, the farther the better, and the faster the better. But her physical strength was really not good. She was already panting after running just a short distance. The ordinary residential building looked like an endless abyss to her. She glanced at it one last time, not with fondness, but with fear.

Then, Su Yuqing hailed a speeding taxi.

"Little girl, where to?"

Su Yuqing adjusted the baseball cap she was wearing, which concealed her short hair quite well. Just by looking at her face, no one would ever think she was a boy.

“The city train station.”

"Alright, little girl, how old are you? Are you in elementary or junior high? Why are you out alone, not with your parents?"

The taxi driver was quite chatty and a bit annoying.

Su Yuqing didn't respond, only quietly looking out the window, watching the taxi speed down the road with few people or cars, watching the rows of trees rushing backward...

Her thoughts returned to yesterday.

Her parents had discovered the medicines that Su Yuqing had hidden in the cabinet, and the women's clothes she had secretly stashed in the corner were also found.

She didn't know what she had done to make her parents suspect her and conduct such a thorough room search. She only knew that things had been exposed.

"What is this medicine?" Her mother's eyes were no longer as gentle as usual but had become a bit stern.

"Just ordinary cold medicine," Su Yuqing said, looking up at the ceiling, trying to evade the question.

"And what about these clothes?"

"..."

"Slap!" Her father seemed infuriated by Su Yuqing's silence and slapped her face, leaving a five-finger mark on her fair and delicate cheek.

"Speak! What exactly is this medicine!"

"Cold medicine."

"Still being stubborn!" Her father slapped Su Yuqing's face again, yelling with red eyes, "I've at least been to school for a few years, I can read the words on the instructions, do you think I don’t know what this is?! Progynova, containing large amounts of estrogen; spironolactone, a drug with a strong anti-androgenic effect, and you're calling it cold medicine?!"

"..." Su Yuqing bit her lip, remaining silent.

"Tell me, how long have you been taking it?" Her mother tried to calm herself, but she was only slightly better than her father.

"..."

"Speak!"

"..."

"When did you start taking it?" Her mother asked from a different angle.

"Won’t you speak?!" Her father stood up, brandishing a whip that he had gotten from somewhere, and whipped it down hard.

Her mother quickly stopped her father, but Su Yuqing still backed away in fear, falling to the ground. Looking at her terrifying father, tears streamed from her eyes uncontrollably.

"You're still crying?! What are you crying for?! Tell me! When did you start taking it!"

Su Yuqing finally couldn’t help but cry because of her father's words. The last fragile line of defense in her heart was destroyed.

“Wuu… wuu…” Su Yuqing covered her red cheek, backing away in fear, and said, trembling, “Thir…thirteen…”

“Thirteen years old?!” Her father’s eyes widened in anger, and he grabbed Su Yuqing, questioning, “That means you've been taking it for two years? Is that right?!”

"Wuu… wuu…" Su Yuqing choked, unable to say a word.

"How could I have a son like you! No wonder I said why you're not developing..."

"Alright, father, getting angry won’t help," her mother persuaded her father, looking at Su Yuqing, and said, “Xiao Qing, starting now, can you go back to being a boy?”

"I… I don’t want to…"

"Let's get a haircut, okay? Look, your hair is already past your ears. Let's get a buzz cut, okay?"

"No, I don’t want to!"

“Don’t want to? If you don’t want to, get out of this house, you’re not worthy of being my son!” her father shouted.

“No… I don’t want to…”

Su Yuqing struggled hard, but her body, weakened by the estrogen and anti-androgen medications, was no match for her father.

After a fierce struggle, she was dragged up and taken to the barber shop.

She just stared blankly as her carefully protected shoulder-length hair was quickly shaved off by the buzzing clippers...

Back at home, Su Yuqing lay on the bed like a soulless doll.

All her medications and women's clothing were burned by her father with a lighter.

"I'll give you one night to think it over, whether you want to be my son, or get out of this house!"

Even in her daze, her father's words were still so deafening...
