# 7 · The Tiger Landlady

A genuine smile illuminated Su Yuqing's delicate face.

Finding a job meant her life could finally stabilize.  All that remained was finding a place to live.

Su Yuqing patted the two hundred yuan and a stack of smaller bills in her pocket, relieved they were still there.

There were plenty of farmer's houses nearby; finding somewhere to stay shouldn't be a problem, right?

"Excuse me, landlady… are there any places to rent around here?"  Getting directions would be easier than searching alone.

"Oh?  Young lady, you don't have a place to stay?"

"Y-yes…"

"We don't have any room in the shop."

"Doesn't Tiger have a vacant room?" The owner, who was chopping vegetables, looked up.  Small noodle shops rarely hired separate cooks; the owner usually filled that role.

"You reminded me! Tiger's been asking us to find someone for that empty room."

Things went surprisingly smoothly, and Su Yuqing felt a surge of hope.  Still, to avoid disappointment, she said, "Um… I don't have much… money… if the rent is too expensive…"

"It's cheap. I'll take you there now."

"Thank you, landlady!"

The seemingly forty-something landlady smiled warmly, gently adjusting Su Yuqing's clothes. "Let's go, young lady."

"Mm!"

The landlady's kindness instantly put Su Yuqing at ease.  Even though the job would be tiring, it would likely be enjoyable.

Working, supporting herself, earning her own money… no longer relying on her parents…

What a life to aspire to.

"Young lady, I was wondering… why are you wearing boys' clothes?" Walking down the somewhat chilly street, the landlady looked at Su Yuqing with gentle eyes.

Su Yuqing's girl's clothes had been burned by her parents.  She'd chosen less masculine attire, but it still looked like boy's clothing.

"Actually… um…" Su Yuqing bit her lip, hesitating. "I… I'm… I'm a boy…"

Su Yuqing's voice was always soft, delicate, and childlike due to her undeveloped vocal cords.  Coupled with her pretty face, it made it impossible to imagine she was a boy.

"A boy?" The landlady looked at Su Yuqing in slight surprise, seeming to scrutinize her for any masculine features.

Her chest was flat, but that was common for girls her age. What about her figure?

Her frame was petite, with narrow shoulders and pretty, crescent-shaped collarbones…

She looked like an undeveloped girl, not at all like a boy.

Since the landlady would find out she was a boy when she started working, she might as well tell her now.

Su Yuqing gritted her teeth and took off her baseball cap, revealing her short, shameful haircut.

Only then did the landlady see a hint of masculinity in Su Yuqing, though feminine features still predominated. She looked like a pretty boy.

"Such a pretty child," the landlady chuckled, patting Su Yuqing's head. "You'll be a handsome man when you grow up."

Su Yuqing shyly lowered her head, grateful for the landlady's acceptance and fortunate to be working under her.

There were still many kind people in the world.

"Young… um, young man, what's your name?" The landlady dropped her curiosity about Su Yuqing's appearance.

Su Yuqing was relieved by her lack of further questioning.

Too many such questions would have been bothersome, even if well-intentioned.

"Um… my name is… Su Yuqing."

"Su Yuqing? That sounds like a girl's name."

"Mm…" Su Yuqing's face flushed crimson. It was a girl's name.

Her parents had assumed she would be a girl and chosen the name before she was born.  Having a boy wasn't a big deal—they could just change the name.

But Su Yuqing's name wasn't chosen by her parents but by the family, specifically her great-grandfather, over a century old.

It had been officially enshrined in the family register and couldn't be changed.

So, even as a boy, Su Yuqing remained Su Yuqing.

Perhaps because of her name, her parents sometimes treated her like a girl when she was young. She even wore a dress to kindergarten…

Adults saw it as a funny anecdote, but the seed of wanting to be a girl might have been sown early on.

"Can I call you Xiaoqing?" the landlady asked.

"Y-yes…"

"Xiaoqing, you seem very shy."

"D-do I…" Su Yuqing's ears turned red.  She fidgeted with her clothes, looking like a quintessential girl.

"Living alone in this city?"

"Mm…"

"That must be hard." The landlady patted Su Yuqing's shoulder, seemingly recalling past memories.  "Living alone is tough. But it's easier for you men.  We women… can't do this, can't do that, and get bullied…"

“…”

Life was already difficult for an ordinary woman alone; for a boy who wanted to be a girl, it would be even harder.

The landlady led Su Yuqing down a narrow alley, filled with oddly shaped farmer's houses, crowded and dirty.

Each house had an overflowing trash can, with garbage piled high around them, emitting a stench of rotting food.

The landlady stopped in front of a cleaner, better-looking house than the others.  The trash can was full but not overflowing, and the smell was much less pungent.

"Tiger!" The landlady called out.

A group of people were playing mahjong. A burly middle-aged woman looked up.  "Landlady, what brings you here?"

"I have business for you." The landlady pushed Su Yuqing forward. "This young one needs to rent a room.  Do you have a vacancy?"

"Sure do.  Is this kid renting alone?"

"Yes."

"Hold on! I'll be right there after this hand!" The woman, Tiger, yelled loud enough for the whole building to hear.

"Hu!  Got it!"

"A pure sequence! I win! Pay up, pay up!"

"Tiger's lucky today."

"When is Tiger unlucky?" Tiger laughed, and hopped onto a stool. "Pay up! I have business to attend to!"

"Here you go, young lady, come with me. I'll show you the room!" Tiger beckoned Su Yuqing.

"Tiger, he's a boy." The landlady said with a smile.

"What? This is a boy?  Wow, he's handsome."

"He's a boy?  I was thinking of him for my son." Said one of the mahjong players.

"Even if he was a girl, he's not for your son."

"I don't like that.  My son might not be handsome, but he's responsible."

"Spare me the lies. Last time, I saw your son surrounded by women, just like you in your youth, huh?"

They were clearly close friends; teasing was part of their affection.

"Alright, alright. I'll take this young… young man to see the room."

The stairs were narrow, barely wide enough for one person, even narrower with anything in hand.

The remaining room was small, about ten square meters, sparsely furnished—a large bed, a small wall-mounted wardrobe, a wobbly wooden table, and a relatively new chair.

Barely enough for living.

But the room had advantages: a small bathroom within the ten square meters. At least bathing and using the toilet wouldn't require going outside.

Su Yuqing examined the room.  The entrance was a short hallway, with the bathroom on the left, then the bed, table, chair, and wardrobe.

A window in front of the desk provided good lighting; the only window in the room.
