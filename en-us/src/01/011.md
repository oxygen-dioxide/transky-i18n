# 11 · Taking the First Real Step

The ramen shop finally closed at nine o'clock at night.  Su Yuqing gently massaged her aching calves, walking home in the cool night air.

“Busy all day long… so tired…” Su Yuqing yawned, wearily pulling out her keys to open her apartment door and entering her small room.

Although her work hours were long and her pay wasn't high, the food was good.  She could eat whatever she wanted from the ramen shop. The only downside was her small appetite; a small bowl of noodles was usually enough to fill her up.

It was late, and she had to get up early tomorrow.

“I should wash my face and brush my teeth and go to sleep…” Su Yuqing murmured, carefully washing up in the bathroom.

Although she didn't have facial cleanser, she still washed her face three times.  Once would have been enough to feel clean and refreshed, but for Su Yuqing, who had a slight潔癖, washing more times made her feel better.

“Ugh… another pimple…” Su Yuqing worriedly looked at herself in the mirror. A new pimple had appeared next to the one from this morning, and the original one looked much larger.  It was probably because her hat had been suffocating her skin all day.

Su Yuqing had never had pimples before.  The appearance of pimples meant her body was starting to develop.  Taking the medication only twice or three times a month was ultimately not enough to suppress her body's growth hormones.

There's a limit to delaying puberty. Unless Su Yuqing started taking medications containing estrogen and anti-androgen daily, allowing estrogen to outweigh testosterone, it might allow her body to develop in a more feminine direction.

Su Yuqing stared at herself in the mirror. She had well-proportioned and delicate features. While not exceptionally beautiful, she was at least striking, a pretty girl.  As a girl, she might be considered average, but for a boy, her face was quite beautiful.

Su Yuqing pouted at her reflection, making a cute expression.

Her large eyes were sparkling, her long eyelashes fluttering slightly.  These were her most beautiful features, apart from her short hair, there was nothing that looked particularly masculine about her.

With such a cute face, if it developed under the influence of testosterone, it would probably deform quickly.  Right now, Su Yuqing's face was baby-faced, but after development, it might become more angular, and she would grow a beard…

At the thought of having a beard, Su Yuqing felt a shiver down her spine. A beard on her face—the thought was terrifying…

“Whew… the textbook said that if development starts, it will be very fast, maybe a different look every week…” Su Yuqing recalled what her teacher had taught in middle school. While many girls were shy about physiology, Su Yuqing studied it carefully. Learning about physiology allowed her to understand growth hormones and male and female hormones.

It also showed her that becoming a girl wasn't impossible in this world; it could be achieved through surgery.  While not as complete as a natural girl… at least the outward appearance wouldn't be too different.

Su Yuqing knew more about this than her peers. She had even researched it specifically. For a time, she spent her days in the library, struggling with the complex terminology, trying to understand their meaning…

“If it's already started… time… might be running out.” Su Yuqing gently placed her hand on her chest. It was flat; she could feel the bones beneath her skin.  Slightly blushing, she murmured, “If I develop in a feminine way, will I have soft breasts…”

Breasts were the secondary sexual characteristic of a girl. In Su Yuqing's view, having breasts like a girl meant taking another step towards becoming a girl, something that people like her longed for.

Su Yuqing closed her eyes and slowly opened them. In this small bathroom, in front of this mirror, she made her decision.

“…Then… let’s start…”

Su Yuqing hadn’t dared to eat too much at home for fear that breast development would arouse her parents' suspicions.  Running away from home was partly to allow herself more freedom to do what she wanted, and taking these medications was one of those things.

There was no need to hesitate; this had been brewing in her mind for a long time. Now, it was simply a matter of course.

Su Yuqing opened a drawer. Several boxes of medicine were neatly arranged inside. She took out a pink box labeled Progynova and a box of small white bottles of spironolactone.

She slowly opened the boxes. From the pink box, she took out a pack of Progynova. Progynova is commonly used to supplement estrogen for menopausal women.  It can also be used as an estrogen replacement or, simply put, it is estrogen.

Spironolactone is a diuretic with anti-androgenic properties. It doesn't have many other advantages, but it's cheap, affordable for Su Yuqing.

Before, Su Yuqing only took half a Progynova tablet, and only occasionally. She didn't know if it had any effect, but now, having decided to start, Su Yuqing decided to take two tablets a day. This would quickly allow estrogen to take over, allowing her to control the direction of her development.

She learned all this from a trans girl friend online.

Su Yuqing's family wasn't poor, which is why she had her own computer at this time. And because her family wasn't poor, she had plenty of pocket money to buy medicine and women's clothing…

Su Yuqing opened her water cup. The water was from the shop; otherwise, the only water Su Yuqing could drink at home was raw water.

She placed two small tablets in her palm. There was no hesitation, only a slight excitement, because she was finally able to take that first real step.

Su Yuqing placed the two tablets under her tongue. Progynova had a sugary coating, sweet at first, but bitter after the coating dissolved.  After the coating dissolved, Su Yuqing poured water into her mouth, swallowing the pills with the water.

Placing the pills under the tongue was to maximize their effectiveness.

Then came the spironolactone. Su Yuqing poured out six pills at once and popped them into her mouth. This time she didn't hold them under her tongue, but swallowed them directly with water.

“So bitter…” No matter how many times she took it, spironolactone was always bitter, like swallowing bile; even the water tasted bitter.

Su Yuqing drank the rest of the water in one gulp and sat cross-legged on the bed.

“So many blisters…” Su Yuqing held her tender feet, which didn't look like those of a boy, gently touching the blisters on her soles. Blisters on the soles of her feet hurt when she walked, and they hurt constantly, without ever numbing.

Su Yuqing squeezed the blister, trying to pop it, but it hurt even with the slightest pressure; she couldn't bring herself to do it.

A needle would be better.  The thought of squeezing it with her hands made her wince.

“Right, there’s a needle.” Su Yuqing picked up a badge on the table.  The front of the badge was Doraemon, bought at an amusement park, one of her favorites.

Su Yuqing closed her eyes, pointed the sharpest part of the badge at the blister on her foot, and gently pressed it. After feeling it touch the blister, she pressed harder, piercing the blister.

“Oof—owww—!”

Su Yuqing cried out in pain, tears welling up in her eyes. After popping one blister, she trembled. She slowly opened her eyes, tears still in her eyes.

Su Yuqing gritted her teeth and popped the other three blisters.  Pus and blood oozed out.  Wearily, she wiped them away with a tissue and lay down on the bed, exhausted.

Perhaps because the pain was so intense, Su Yuqing felt her feet go numb. Or maybe it was just numbness.

The numbness didn't last long, however, and the burning sensation returned, constantly overwhelming her.

Su Yuqing was afraid of pain, and now she had no strength left, and felt like she didn't even want to move her fingers.

“It hurts so much…” After ten minutes, the pain subsided slightly. Su Yuqing turned off the light and burrowed into her covers. “Go to sleep… it won’t hurt when I'm asleep…”

…

It was late at night.  The moon, hidden behind clouds, couldn't cast its light on the earth.  Only a few of the brightest stars dotted the night sky.

Almost everyone in this residential area had turned off their lights, plunged into darkness.

“Thump, thump, thump…”

Su Yuqing woke up suddenly from her dream. She clutched her rapidly beating heart; sweat covered her forehead.

It seemed like she had just had a terrifying nightmare, but upon waking, Su Yuqing couldn't remember what she had dreamt.  Only that her heart felt blocked, heavy.

“Huff… huff… huff…” Su Yuqing gasped, breathing in fresh oxygen.

Her heart felt better, but the palpitations hadn't completely subsided.  The feeling was maddening.

It was as if something important had happened, but she didn't know what it was; as if something was missing, but she couldn't remember where she'd put it…

Su Yuqing closed her eyes again, feeling as if she were in an empty city, the surrounding silence eerie and terrifying. On the deserted streets outside, something terrifying seemed to be wandering…

She couldn't sleep, no matter how hard she tried.  It was so uncomfortable…

The feeling of something blocking her chest kept Su Yuqing tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep.
