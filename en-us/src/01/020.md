# 20 · The Fish That Wanted to Become an Eagle

“Oh~ Taking a break?  Aren't you supposed to work seven days a week at a place like this?”

Of course, it was because Su Yuqing wasn't feeling well that the kind-hearted boss and his wife gave her a day off each week.  The real reason was far too complicated to explain, however, and Su Yuqing remained silent, a perfectly acceptable response to such a lengthy question.

“Um… you don’t look old enough to be working, do you?” the young man asked.

Su Yuqing didn’t like people who were so inquisitive.  She found it rather annoying, but due to her excellent upbringing, she simply mumbled a response.

The young man also saw that Su Yuqing wasn't keen on talking to him, so he fell silent as well.

Su Yuqing suddenly felt a pang of guilt.  He didn't seem malicious; he just wanted to chat.  Her attitude had been too cold…

After all, they were the only two people on this riverbank…

“You… you?  Aren’t you working either?” Su Yuqing asked, summoning her courage.  Her face, which had just returned to normal, flushed crimson again as she spoke.

Thanks to her experience handing out flyers yesterday, she wasn’t as shy around strangers as before. She still stuttered a bit, but overall, she was much more fluent.

Society is a potent medicine that fosters rapid growth and maturity.

“Ha—I don’t have a fixed job. I spend most of my time traveling,” the young man said, once Su Yuqing opened the conversation. He spoke incessantly, as if a dam had broken.  “I like to visit different cities. This small town is the third city I’ve been to, and compared to the first two, the pace of life is incredibly slow… I stayed in each of the first two cities for a year, but I really like this city, so I might stay longer…”

“…” Su Yuqing listened quietly, thinking that in a way, they were alike. They both walked a path that others didn't approve of, pursuing their dreams.

This young man’s dream was to travel, which differed greatly from the norm. Most people want stable jobs, the ability to support their families, and a somewhat repetitive life…

Though he didn’t say it, Su Yuqing imagined his parents must have disapproved.

Because of this, Su Yuqing felt a connection with him, and no longer felt as resistant to him as before.

“Ha… Sorry, I tend to talk a lot. You must be bored,” the young man said, scratching his head and looking at Su Yuqing with a gentle smile.

Su Yuqing shyly averted her gaze, looking at the clear water.  “No… no… it’s fine…”

“Ha… Actually, I travel to write more interesting stories. Oh, right, how about I tell you a story?”

“Mm…” Su Yuqing nodded gently.

The unkempt young man cleared his throat, gazing at the somewhat glaring sun and speaking in a low, slightly magnetic voice.

“A long, long time ago… so long ago that even humanity’s ancestors were still eating raw meat…”

“There was a fish living in the sea that longed to become an eagle, soaring freely in the sky.”

“The sea is vast, but compared to the boundless sky, it’s pitifully small.”

“This fish, though small, was strong.  It had been to every corner of the sea, but it was unwilling to be confined to this one sea, wanting to reach the wider sky.”

“So, the fish prayed to God.”

“God answered it, but didn’t intend to help.”

“How can a fish become a bird? This is the law of nature, and even God must abide by the laws He has created.”

“Shouldn’t God be kind…?” Su Yuqing, captivated by the story, asked.  Since they were more comfortable with each other, her speech flowed more naturally.

“Ha, yes, God is merciful, so He wouldn’t destroy the laws of nature.  Just as a fish will eventually die of old age or be eaten by a predator; just as flowers will eventually wither or be blown away by strong winds…”

“Birth, aging, sickness, and death are the laws of nature, experienced by all living things; God won’t break them, that is His mercy…”

“If a person truly became immortal, would their life be perfect and happy? A world with regrets is perfect, it is beautiful; God protects this ‘beauty’ that the world cannot understand.”

“Mm…” Su Yuqing nodded, seemingly understanding.

“But this strong fish didn’t give up. It prayed to a demon, and was quickly answered.”

“Demons can grant any wish, but the price for each wish must be paid. This is a normal exchange. Demons don't give freely, but they are the most qualified and honest merchants.”

“What was the price…?” Su Yuqing asked.

The young man shook his head. “The demon didn’t say, but it gave the fish some glittering gemstones.  Once the fish ate all the gemstones, it would transform into a bird.”

“Huh?”

“Haha… Don't you think the demon is more like God, and God, more like a demon?”

“Um… kind of…”

“Actually, God and demons are just different philosophies. There is no absolute good or absolute evil in this world…” The young man touched his beard stubble, picked a blade of grass, and chewed on it gently. “So the fish began to strive for its dream, eating a glittering gemstone every day to become a bird.”

“There were exactly three hundred and sixty-five gemstones. In other words, in one year, the fish would transform into a bird that could soar in the sky.”

“At first, besides finding the gemstones hard to eat, there were no other effects.”

“Later, the fish began to change. The fins on its sides grew larger and wider, like the rudiments of wings.”

“The fish was overjoyed, and it worked even harder, imagining the day it would become an eagle.”

“The fish’s body changed day by day. Its scales began to fall off, and it looked less and less like a fish—and also not like a bird. It became something in between.”

“The other fish attacked this strange fish. Although this fish was the strongest in the shoal, it could only flee in panic when faced with so many attackers.  Because of its changing body, it was difficult for it to adapt, and it could not exert its full strength.”

“No shoal could tolerate this anomaly, and it was chased and attacked by every shoal that discovered it.”

“Even though it escaped quickly, over time, it was covered in wounds.”

“Old wounds didn’t heal before new ones appeared.”

“The gemstones themselves had no side effects, except perhaps that during the transformation process, it would not be accepted by any other fish.”

“With only sixty gemstones left out of three hundred and sixty-five, the fish was increasingly bird-like, but it faced a serious problem: it found it increasingly difficult to breathe underwater.”

“Naturally, since birds can’t breathe underwater.”

“The fish was no longer attacked by other fish, as it looked completely like a bird now. It could even flap out of the water and glide in the air for a few seconds.”

“However, the fish shoals no longer attacked it, but the birds began to reject it—rejecting this strange bird.”

“The fish continued to hide itself. Finally, only five gemstones remained.”

“At this point, it was in its greatest predicament.  It could barely get enough oxygen in the water, nor in the air. Even if other creatures no longer attacked it, it might die of lack of oxygen.”

“The fish… struggled through five more days and finally transformed into a magnificent eagle.”

“But it still had wounds, and they hadn't healed. One wound, inflicted by a bird’s beak on the final day, went straight to its heart.”

“The fish… no, the eagle that was once a fish, spread its wings and flew into the boundless blue sky, past the cold and soft white clouds, overlooking the sea below and the distant land.”

“It finally experienced the feeling of soaring freely in the sky.”

“It endured the pain in its heart, flapping its wings hard, trying to fly higher and farther…”

“The eagle gazed at the distant scenery and then, convulsing, fell down.”

“The demon appeared beside it and asked if it regretted it?”

“The eagle didn’t regret it. Its only regret was not being able to experience the thrill of flight for longer, not being able to see the azure, boundless sky for longer…”

“The eagle finally fell back into the sea, where it was born and where it died.”

“…”

The story ended there, but Su Yuqing didn’t speak. She just stared blankly into the distance at the rippling lake.

The young man touched his chin, sat up, and quietly glanced at Su Yuqing, noticing two glistening tears on her face.

Su Yuqing noticed him looking, quickly turning away and wiping away the tears with her fingers. Though the tears stopped, her eyes were still red.

Even though the young man didn’t ask anything, Su Yuqing nervously explained, “Th-that… that… was the wind… the wind.”

“Ha… I know. Sorry, did I bring back bad memories?”

“No…” Su Yuqing shook her head.

She hadn’t fully understood the meaning of the story, but she felt instinctively sad, that was all.

This story had different meanings for different people, but for Su Yuqing, it was especially touching, which is why she felt sad… that’s all.

Yes, that’s all.
