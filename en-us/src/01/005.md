# 5 · Stranded on the Streets

Night fell completely.  The small city, though not as bustling as Hangzhou, still glittered with neon lights.  Near the train station, restaurants were especially lively at night, bustling with customers.

Su Yuqing walked aimlessly down the street, her eyes unfocused, unsure of where she was going or what she was doing.

She just kept walking.

She walked for a long time, the shops around her becoming fewer and fewer. Even the street vendors were packing up.

It must have been midnight.

Su Yuqing felt as if her soul had been drained.  Though her feet were numb, she kept walking.

Only when her legs grew weak and could barely support her did Su Yuqing finally stop.

It was very late.  Except for a 24-hour convenience store, all the other shops were closed.

Dark clouds still covered the sky, blocking out the moonlight and starlight.

Aside from the dim streetlights, nothing else glowed.

Although it was spring, Su Yuqing felt a desolate and bleakness.

She wearily sat down by the roadside with her suitcase, feeling immense confusion and anxiety.

A cold wind blew gently, causing Su Yuqing to hug herself tighter, jolting her numb nerves back to life.

Without money, she couldn't go anywhere. But at least, Su Yuqing was still alive.  As long as she was alive, there was hope. Money could be earned again, but if she gave up now, she might really starve to death on the streets…

Or maybe just become a one-day newspaper headline, quickly forgotten by time.

"If this is fate, then I'll defy it! I won't let it have its way!" Su Yuqing bit her lip, clenched her fists, and shouted at the dark night sky.

In the quiet night, Su Yuqing's shout echoed faintly, as if reaffirming her resolve.

Yes, since she had decided to become a girl, since she had chosen this path that defied "God," she had already decided to fight fate to the end.  This was just a small setback, what did it matter?

Children's emotions are unstable. They easily become sad, easily become lost, and easily regain their determination and strength…

Su Yuqing was just at that age.

In the distance was a small gas station. This was a long highway; ahead was a deserted bus stop, and behind, an old, abandoned little wooden house.

Su Yuqing, exhausted, wanted to go to the little house to spend the night. But unfortunately, the door was locked tight.  Although the lock was rusty, Su Yuqing couldn't open it.

"Sigh… Forget it…" Su Yuqing was so weak she could barely stand, let alone open a door.  She quickly gave up and sat down beside the little house.

It was too late to find a job with meals provided, and Su Yuqing didn’t have the money for a hotel.

So she could only rest here for the night and look for a solution when the sun rose.

Humans are fragile, so fragile that a small thing can cause a mental breakdown; but humans are also strong, strong enough to grit their teeth and struggle to survive even in adversity.

"Hope" is the spark that keeps humans strong. Thinking of future happiness always brings a sense of peace.

Even though she didn’t have a cent, Su Yuqing still thought tomorrow would be better, looking forward to the sunrise, looking forward to finding a suitable job…

"So hungry…"

Su Yuqing touched the moss on the wooden house wall, rubbing her empty stomach. Her stomach protested constantly, and her body lacked the energy to recover.

If the moss were edible, Su Yuqing would have eaten a big handful without hesitation.

"Right… There's still food…"

Just as Su Yuqing couldn’t bear the hunger, she suddenly remembered the Nian Gao (glutinous rice cake) she’d had for lunch. She’d only eaten half; there was still half left, enough to fill her stomach.

The thought of the rich filling in the Nian Gao made her even hungrier.

The Nian Gao was already cold, and because it was made of glutinous rice, it had become very hard when cold, hard enough to chip her teeth.

But for the hungry Su Yuqing, it was heaven's best gift.

Perhaps this is what they mean by, "Heaven never closes all doors."

Su Yuqing chewed the Nian Gao slowly, bite by bite. She bit off a small piece, letting it soften in her mouth before chewing carefully, as if wanting to deeply imprint the flavor in her mind.

To a hungry person, any food is delicious.

Actually, Su Yuqing didn't like carrots very much before, but today she found the cold shredded carrots in the Nian Gao to be a delicacy. She had never tasted such delicious carrots…

Hardship and tribulation really change a person.

Su Yuqing finished the half Nian Gao, still feeling a little unsatisfied, but soon her stomach felt a little uncomfortable.  But this feeling of fullness was much better than hunger.

At least, even with a bloated stomach, Su Yuqing felt a little happy.

Sometimes, happiness is such a simple thing.

The spring night was cold.

Su Yuqing hugged her backpack, lying sideways on her suitcase, curled up to keep warm. But the occasional cold wind always carried away her little warmth.

"So… so cold…" Su Yuqing's lips were purplish, and her hands and feet were icy.  Sleeping in this weather, she would probably catch a cold tomorrow.

Only then did Su Yuqing realize how comfortable and warm her soft Simmons bed at home was…

She wanted a home, a warm home. The house didn't have to be big, just windproof and waterproof, with a bed covered in soft blankets…

Su Yuqing thought silently in her heart, unable to resist the exhaustion of body and mind, closed her eyes, and fell into a drowsy sleep.

This sleep was restless.  Su Yuqing woke up every hour from the cold, only able to move a little to warm herself before falling asleep again.

"Rumble—whoosh—" Occasionally, a speeding car would pass on the highway, adding a dull "beat" to the quiet road.

The roadside wasn't completely silent. There were the sounds of wind rustling through leaves; the scurrying of wild rats sneaking out of the sewers to forage; and the "pitiful" cries of wild cats, like a baby's whimper…

Su Yuqing had a broken dream.

She dreamed that she couldn't survive outside and went home, only to be driven out by her parents. The home that should have been warm was so cold, and her once kind parents became so unfamiliar.

In her dream, she started wandering again, but somehow revealed her identity. People on the street pointed and whispered at her, some even openly insulted her.  The onlookers only watched and laughed, even laughing harder.

Later, Su Yuqing was abducted by human traffickers, her valuable organs sold, and her limbs cut off, turning her into a beggar on the street, enduring physical and mental torture every day for a meager meal…

And her parents, when they saw her on the street, not only didn't pity her, but kicked over her begging bowl and laughed at her…

The dream ended.

Tears streamed down Su Yuqing's face. She covered her chest, her heart beating slowly.

Although it was only a dream, why did that piercing pain feel so real, so… heart-wrenching?

Su Yuqing hugged herself tight, like a weak, helpless kitten, afraid, timid, shivering.

She didn't want that. She didn't want to live like that. She didn't want to turn back; she wanted to keep going… keep moving towards her dream.

Gender is given by God, she couldn't choose it, but why couldn't she fight back later? Why didn't she have the right to choose her gender?

Just because of those constraints of human ethics and morality?

Su Yuqing opened her eyes. Her eyes were clear, like unpolluted spring water.

She looked soft and weak, but beneath that weakness lay unconquerable stubbornness.

She refused to accept it, so she would fight.

The dark clouds covering the sky had dissipated sometime during the night.  In the clear night sky, not a single cloud obscured the cold moon hanging high, showering Su Yuqing with its gentle light.

The small city wasn't developed, and precisely because it wasn’t, she could still see the myriad stars scattered across the sky.

Looking at the moon and countless stars in the sky, Su Yuqing's loneliness lessened somewhat.

No matter what, it's still here with me. It won’t forsake me because of my identity or my gender. Its light is always there, always guiding me…

Whether it's the moon, the sun, or the starlight.

It was already dawn. The moon was about to set, and a golden light appeared on the eastern horizon, painting that small patch of sky gold.

The sky would brighten soon.

It seemed like it would be a nice day.

Although she hadn't slept well, and even caught a chill, Su Yuqing felt unusually invigorated. A new day had come, meaning new hope.

Before setting off, Su Yuqing decided to search her bag and suitcase again. Maybe she could find her wallet tucked away somewhere?
