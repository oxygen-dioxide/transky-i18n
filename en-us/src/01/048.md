# 48 · The Hoodlums

Su Yuqing’s face went white, her panic rendering her immobile.

“Su Yuqing? Home?  Paying the water and electricity bill!”  A booming voice—Lao Hu’s—rattled the door.

Lao Hu had a good relationship with Aunt Zhang and probably knew Su Yuqing had Mondays off.

Lao Hu’s shout jolted Su Yuqing back to reality.  She quickly slipped off her shirt and skirt, but Lao Hu outside was clearly impatient, her knocking growing louder.

“Are you in there?”

“Coming, coming…” Su Yuqing called back, but dared not delay.  Removing her socks proved slower than taking off her clothes.  She had no choice but to pull on her pants and shirt, then ran to the door barefoot.

“What’s taking you so long?” Impatience was etched on Lao Hu’s face, and she looked like she’d just lost money…

Gamblers are at their worst after losing. Su Yuqing knew not to provoke her, so she just chuckled nervously and scratched her ear, pretending not to hear the complaints.

“Water bill is 6 kuai, electricity is 17 kuai, that’s 23 kuai in total.”

“Oh… okay…” Su Yuqing scurried back to her room, retrieving three ten-kuai notes from the back of a drawer.  She hurried back to the door and handed them to the landlady.

“Mm, seven kuai change.” The landlady glanced at the money, pocketed it, then tossed a crumpled five-kuai note and two coins to Su Yuqing.

“Thank you.” Su Yuqing replied politely.

“Your hair’s grown long,” Lao Hu turned, then looked at Su Yuqing again.  “You should cut it, or you’ll really look like a girl.”

“Um…” Su Yuqing’s expression was awkward, but thankfully Lao Hu said nothing more and “thump-thump-thumped” down the stairs.

“Whew…” Su Yuqing breathed a sigh of relief, closed the door, and double-checked the lock before returning to her room.

Lao Hu’s interruption had squashed any desire to continue dressing up.  Su Yuqing took off her clothes again, folded them neatly, and put them in a plastic bag.

Leaving worn clothes in the wardrobe might affect other garments, but washing them after one wear was excessive…

“Next week,” Su Yuqing sighed softly, her heart, previously racing from fright, having calmed down.

It was worth noting that under her trousers, Su Yuqing had been wearing white girls' stockings and underwear…

Cleaning for a few hours was exhausting, especially as Su Yuqing's body was becoming increasingly frail. Working that long inevitably required rest.

She snuggled into bed and soon fell asleep under the covers.

In the past, Su Yuqing would spend her free time reading, but now, if she had time, she was more likely to sleep…

She only ate a few small fish snacks while feeding Cookie that morning, but Su Yuqing didn’t feel hungry.  She could eat, but didn’t feel that hungry…

Maybe it was a stomach problem.

But Su Yuqing found it quite convenient, at least it saved money. On her days off, two meals, or even just one, would suffice.

She’d go out and eat something after waking up.

Su Yuqing mused sleepily.

…

Before her stood a dilapidated park, behind her, a pitch-black void.  It was a dream she hadn’t had in a long time.

The park gates were firmly shut. Su Yuqing pushed hard, but they only wobbled.  They wouldn’t open.

The gate wouldn't open?

Su Yuqing was puzzled.  How could she enter the park?  Should she climb over the wall?

Su Yuqing was tired; even in her dream, she wanted to conserve energy, so she looked around for another way in.

And she found one.

One section of the fence had been loosened, the gap significantly wider than the others. Though narrow, it was just big enough for Su Yuqing to squeeze through.

Su Yuqing wriggled through the gap and into the park.

“Snap.”  A dry twig broke under her foot.

“Creak—creak——” As usual, the rusty swing set produced a grating sound, which oddly reassured Su Yuqing.  At least she knew it was harmless.

Today, Su Yuqing didn't want to overthink or wander.  She went straight to the swing.

A small boy sat on a swing, gently rocking. His head was down, his mood somber.

“Sister, you’re finally back,” the boy looked up, forcing a weak smile.

“Your face… what happened?” Su Yuqing asked, concerned.

The boy’s eyes were bruised and red, as if he’d been beaten.

“N-nothing…” The boy shook his head slightly, seemingly unwilling to discuss it.  “Sister, did you find what you were looking for?”

Su Yuqing didn't answer but asked, “Did you find a way out?”

“No…” The boy said dejectedly.  “Others can come in, but I can't get out…”

“Do you know what I’m looking for?”

“How would I know what you're looking for, Sister?” The boy widened his eyes, smiling innocently, though the bruises made him look pitiable.  “You don’t even know, how could I?”

Su Yuqing didn’t want to dwell on the seemingly unanswerable question. She preferred spontaneity, so she asked, “What about those who hit you?”

“They… they’re gone…”

Su Yuqing frowned, patted the boy’s shoulder, and said, “Next time, I’ll help you.”

“You can’t beat them… Sister…” As the boy spoke, the surrounding trees and streetlights began to crumble, like disassembled blocks, dissolving into pixels and falling to the ground.

…

Su Yuqing woke up feeling groggy, perhaps from sleeping too long. She glanced at the clock: eight o'clock at night.

“Forget it… back to sleep?” She lay back down but felt little sleepiness, and her stomach was rumbling.  Even if she fell asleep now, nightmares would likely wake her.

“Okay… let's eat…” Su Yuqing rubbed her grumbling belly, murmuring, “Don’t worry, I’ll take you to eat soon…”

Eight o'clock at night was peak time for night markets.  Streets were lined with stalls selling everything from food to household goods, a variety of novelties overwhelming Su Yuqing.  Some items were crudely made, yet unlike anything she’d ever seen.

The plush toy stalls were particularly captivating.

Alas… no money.

Su Yuqing patted the three kuai in her pocket and ended up buying a sparsely filled rice cake, eating it slowly as she walked home.

She’d walked far, exploring the night market, but now wanted to get back quickly, so she took a shortcut through a narrow alley.

“Hey! Six sixes, full house!” A young man with brightly dyed hair slammed a playing card onto a cardboard box, making a sharp sound. “Damn, who’s got a better hand than me?”

“Hey, Luzi, don’t get cocky, what if someone beats you?”  A nearby punk with yellow hair chuckled.

“Hah? Beat me? If someone beats me, I'm getting a chick for everyone to enjoy tonight!”

“Oh yeah? You got one? You only have six cards, I don't believe they're all full houses!”

“Oh?”

“If Luzi wins, Baigou, you gotta take your pants off and wear them on your head and run naked around here!” The yellow-haired punk egged him on.

“Dare you?!”  The green-haired punk, Luzi, challenged with arrogance.

“This time, you’re done for.” The white-haired punk threw down six eights onto the cardboard box, smugly tilting his chin.  “See? Six eights. Loser pays up, get us a chick to have some fun!”

“Fine, I, Lao Lu, always keep my word. It’s just a chick, no big deal!” Luzi pulled out his phone, about to make a call, but paused.

“What’s wrong? Trying to back out?”

“No, look, how about that chick over there?”

“Pretty young.”

“Looks like fifteen or sixteen, right?”

“She’s young, but she’ll probably be good.”

“She’s wearing a hat and her head’s down; can’t see her face.”

“Let me handle this.” Luzi swaggered, acting like a seasoned player, and approached the “girl.”

“……?” Su Yuqing looked up, puzzled, at Luzi blocking her path.  At the sight of him, her heart sank; he looked like a troublemaker…

“Hey, little chick, lift your head, let me see your pretty face.” Luzi smirked, raising an eyebrow at Su Yuqing.

Su Yuqing fought back her fear, slowly raising her head, hoping that Luzi would see she was a boy and let her pass.

“Wow, pretty cute!”

But Su Yuqing forgot that her face held nothing remotely masculine…

“Can… can I… go… past…” Su Yuqing backed away nervously, whispering.

“Hey, sure, but the brothers get to have some fun first.”

“I… I’m… a… a boy…”

“Hahaha, that’s the funniest joke I’ve ever heard!” Luzi and the other punks burst into laughter.

Su Yuqing's face paled; like a startled deer, she spun around…
