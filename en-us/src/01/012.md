# 12 · Insomnia

The night grew even darker, the moonlight and starlight completely obscured by fog. The nearby streets became increasingly silent, occasionally punctuated by the sounds of stray cats and dogs rummaging through trash cans, but no human voices.

Naturally, at this late hour, few people would be out.

But at this moment, Su Yuqing desperately wished the streets were bustling, the noise perhaps offering some comfort.

Her mind was hazy, wanting to sleep but unable to, wanting to wake but unable to fully clear her head.

This feeling was worse than ordinary insomnia.

“P嗒.” A drop of inky black rain fell to the ground, like a signal for an assault, countless drops of dark rain pouring down.

The rain wasn't heavy, lacking the sizzling sound of frying beans. It was gentle and soft, seemingly endless, likely to last for a long time.

The alarm clock rang. Though the outside was still pitch black, the time was already 5:20 AM.

Su Yuqing felt her head heavy, struggling to sit up in bed, looking out the window.

The raindrops outside were linear, like a watercolor painting, possessing a strange beauty.

But Su Yuqing had no mood to appreciate it. She hadn't slept all night, yet she had to go to work. For her wages, for her livelihood, she had to get up and go.

“嘶——” As soon as Su Yuqing put her feet on the floor, a sharp pain shot through her. The blister that had been punctured yesterday hadn't healed, and the pain of walking on it was even more intense than when it was blistered.

Su Yuqing gritted her teeth, limping to the bathroom.  Feeling completely drained and with the persistent pain in her feet, her washing routine was minimal.

It felt like someone had pulled out all her bones. Sometimes, she felt unsteady even without support.

“唔……” Su Yuqing frowned, her face pained. Half-closing her eyes, she leaned against the wall, carefully making her way downstairs.

The rain, though not heavy, wasn't light either.

Su Yuqing had no umbrella and could only walk in the rain. To minimize the rain, she had to run, but she was barely able to walk; she could only try to find areas with eaves, staying close to the walls, slowly shuffling her steps.

The physical discomfort prevented Su Yuqing from focusing her thoughts. Each time she tried to distract herself, the pain and the tightness in her chest would interrupt her.

“呼……呼……” Su Yuqing crouched under an awning, some rain blown sideways by the wind landing on her.

After only a few steps, she felt utterly exhausted, her chest tight and suffocating.

“Could it be the dosage was too high…?”

If the initial dose is too large, it can burden the heart.

The side effects are significant. It will improve gradually after several times as the body adapts.

Walking and stopping, Su Yuqing finally made it to the noodle shop.  Despite trying to stay under the eaves, her clothes were still quite wet. The wind made her feel icy, like she was frozen solid.

Although it was dark and raining, the owner had opened up early. In the dark street, the light from the noodle shop was so bright, yet so weak…

Zhang Auntie and Li Uncle were already busy.

“Xiaoqing, you’re here.” Zhang Auntie greeted Su Yuqing.

“嗯……” Su Yuqing clutched her chest, managing a weak smile, slowly sitting down. This position felt slightly better.

“Xiaoqing, what’s wrong with you? Your face is pale!”

“I… I’m fine…”

“Didn’t you sleep well? Why don’t you sleep a little longer? It’s raining today; there won’t be many customers.”

“Xiaoqing, you look so frail. Uncle will get you a chicken leg to help you recover. How about stir-fried noodles for your main course?” Li Uncle said loudly.

“嗯……” Su Yuqing weakly nodded, adjusting her hat and immediately rested her head on the table, falling fast asleep – despite having been unable to fall asleep just moments ago.

Su Yuqing realized for the first time how comfortable sleep could be.

Even if it meant becoming a god, she wouldn’t trade it for a good night’s sleep…

“唰啦——唰啦——” The aroma of stir-fried noodles wafted from the kitchen. Li Boss came out with a bowl of noodles, saying to Zhang Auntie, “Wife, get a braised chicken leg, look how tired Xiaoqing is.”

“She’s probably from a poor family, having a weak body is normal, she needs to replenish her strength.” Zhang Auntie nodded and brought out the largest chicken leg, placing it on top of the stir-fried noodles.

Li Boss then carried the noodles with the chicken leg to Su Yuqing’s side.

Even the strong smell of food couldn't wake her.

“Xiaoqing? Xiaoqing?” Li Boss gently nudged Su Yuqing, who showed no reaction, seemingly sleeping soundly.

“It’s breakfast, Xiaoqing.” Zhang Auntie called out as well.

“唔……嗯……” Su Yuqing sleepily rubbed her eyes, seeing the delicious bowl of stir-fried noodles in front of her, yet feeling no appetite.

Even while eating noodles, she was half-asleep, eyes half-closed, appearing to be sleepwalking.

Su Yuqing didn’t know what the food tasted like. She only felt something being bitten and instinctively chewed and swallowed. Even tasteless food has its own flavor, but Su Yuqing felt like she was chewing air.

“咣当.”  Finally succumbing to exhaustion, Su Yuqing fell face-first onto the table, her chopsticks and the half-eaten chicken leg falling to the ground.

“Asleep again?” Li Boss asked.

“She must be terribly exhausted.” Zhang Auntie shook her head gently. “Let her sleep.”

“Yeah, we won’t be busy today anyway.” Li Boss nodded, cleaning the table and moving Su Yuqing to a chair against the wall.

Su Yuqing remained unaffected.  After changing positions, she remained in the same posture, sleeping on the table as if she hadn’t closed her eyes for days.

……

Su Yuqing felt as if she had fallen into an abyss, a bottomless pit, constantly falling.  Surrounding her was pitch-blackness, with nothing visible or perceivable.

Finally, the descent stopped. The surrounding space began to brighten, although only a faint, weak light appeared.

Su Yuqing felt like she was standing at the entrance of a park, with blackness behind her and dim, flickering lights in the park ahead.

She looked behind and then in front of her, hesitating before stepping inside.

It was a desolate and dilapidated park. The trees, unpruned, grew wildly, taking on bizarre shapes, some resembling clawing ghosts.

Weeds had long overtaken the park paths. Su Yuqing walked through weeds that reached her ankles, aimlessly.

The streetlights still emitted a dim, orange-red glow, but the lampposts were rusty, some showing exposed wiring.

The park's exercise equipment was broken or dilapidated: a walker missing a side; a Tai Chi ring with a crack; a waist twister without a tray; a stretching machine with frayed wires…

“吱呀——吱呀——” A jarring sound suddenly echoed through the quiet park, making Su Yuqing’s hair stand on end.

“吱呀——吱呀——”

Su Yuqing looked around fearfully, expecting something terrifying to suddenly jump out and devour her.

“吱呀——吱呀——” The jarring sound continued, seemingly without stopping.

Su Yuqing trembled with fear, but curiosity urged her to cautiously approach the source of the sound.

“吱呀——吱呀——”

The sound grew closer and clearer.  Through a large tree obscuring her view, Su Yuqing saw a shadow swaying up and down, appearing to be a swing.

Was it just a swing moving in the wind?

Su Yuqing bravely went around the tree, reaching the swing. A pretty young boy was sitting on it, swaying back and forth, his features bearing a slight resemblance to Su Yuqing.

The shadow of the swing still swayed up and down, but… the boy had no shadow.

Su Yuqing stood rooted to the spot, afraid to move. The unknown was the most terrifying thing.

“Sister, what are you doing?” The boy smiled. His voice was sweet, his laughter innocent, but to Su Yuqing, it was eerie and terrifying.

“No… nothing…”

“Sister, do you know the way out?”

“The way out…?”

“Yes, I’ve been trapped in this park for a long time and can’t find a way out.” The boy tilted his head, looking at Su Yuqing, innocently asking, “Sister, do you know? I really want to leave here.”

“……I… I don’t know the way out…”

“Then why did you come here, sister? Are you looking for something?”

“Looking for something… I think… I’m looking for something, but… what am I looking for…?” Su Yuqing felt a headache, unable to remember why she was there, what she was looking for.

The surrounding streetlights began to flicker, and everything in the park, including the boy, slowly faded.

The boy smiled at Su Yuqing: “Sister, see you next time.  I hope you’ll take me away next time…”

Everything disappeared.

The world plunged back into darkness.
