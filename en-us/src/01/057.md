# 57 · Is What We See Real?

"Want to come over to my place?" Zhang Sifan asked, stopping his electric scooter in front of Su Yuqing's house.

"No… I don't feel like going out today…"

"Okay, then remember to come over often next time. If you can't make it, just call me, and I'll pick you up."

"Mm… Okay…"

Su Yuqing watched Zhang Sifan disappear from sight before turning to walk home.

Cookie, carrying Coffee, nimbly hopped onto the wall, mewing softly at Su Yuqing, as if saying goodbye.

"Going to play somewhere else?" Su Yuqing asked.

"Meow~" Cookie shook its ears, whether it understood or not was unknown. In any case, it disappeared in a flash.  After all, it was a stray cat; it probably got bored after playing with Su Yuqing for a while and went to look for food.

Su Yuqing walked slowly forward, but found that Cookie hadn't gone far. It was squatting quietly in the grass, as if waiting for something. Coffee had disappeared.

Su Yuqing looked at it questioningly, but the cat didn't react, its gaze fixed on something ahead.  A moment later, an all-white cat emerged from the other side of the grass, with a few grass seeds clinging to its fur.

The two cats exchanged tentative meows, then nuzzled each other, sniffing each other's scent and licking each other's faces, looking very affectionate.

Could it be… Cookie's boyfriend?

The two cats walked side by side into the deeper grass, disappearing from Su Yuqing's sight.  She didn't need to guess what they were going to do…

"Ahem! Cats doing… that… Why am I blushing…" Su Yuqing gently patted her cheeks, lowering her head and continuing to walk, but couldn't help glancing back.

Come to think of it, she had never seen cats… you know… do it.

Su Yuqing stopped at the bottom of her building. It was still early; there wasn't anything to do at home so early.  She regretted it slightly. She should have gone to Zhang Sifan's place.

Mainly, Su Yuqing was worried that she wouldn't want to leave once she got there, and would end up sleeping over at Zhang Sifan's again.  That would mean waking up early the next day to rush to work…

So it was better to refuse directly…

Su Yuqing wanted a lie-in.

Since she didn't want to go home, she decided to go for a stroll elsewhere.

A few blocks away was a Xinhua bookstore. It had two floors. While it didn't have as many books as the Book City in Hangzhou, it still had a decent selection and was one of the few large bookstores in this small city.

She was bored, so she decided to browse.

Su Yuqing was quite interested in literary works, but she didn't own many books.  No matter how good they were, reading them dozens of times would get boring.

It was Monday, so the bookstore was nearly empty. On weekends, there would probably be many children looking at comics or books like "Ten Thousand Whys."

Apart from the occasional staff member, the bookstore was quiet, which was exactly the environment Su Yuqing preferred.

Su Yuqing went straight to the fiction section.  If she liked the title, she would open it and read the synopsis and the beginning. After browsing for a while, she finally picked one she liked, found a corner, and sat down to read.

It was a romance novel, but a rather rare BL novel, and a 16+ one at that, with extensive explicit descriptions…

Every time Su Yuqing encountered such racy content, she would nervously look around to make sure no one was nearby before continuing.

Luckily, Su Yuqing had chosen a corner seat, and the bookstore was nearly empty, allowing her to read the entire novel in peace. Of course, she couldn't avoid feeling flushed.

The little caterpillar between her legs was like a cold, limp french fry, half-hard, half-soft, pressing against her pants, making her feel uncomfortable and awkward.

Fortunately, her pants were loose, and her white caterpillar wasn't large, so it wasn't obvious. Otherwise, a pure and cute "girl" with a tent pitched below would attract a lot of attention, wouldn't she?

Like a thief, Su Yuqing quietly returned the book to the shelf, her mind still replaying the plot, especially those thrilling words and sickeningly sweet love lines…

To calm herself down, Su Yuqing randomly pulled a book from the philosophy section and returned to her corner.

At first, she was distracted, but gradually she became engrossed in the content.

The book was titled, *Is What We See Real?*  It discussed idealistic theories.

Philosophy was something that seemed profound yet vaguely understandable; you felt like you understood something, but what was said was probably nonsense…

Sometimes, the satisfaction came from showing off?

The book argued that the people we see might not be those people, and the things we see might not be those things, because everything is processed by the brain before forming an image in the brain. In other words, if the brain wants to, it can create a plethora of illusions.

Perhaps we are not living beings, or perhaps we don't even have a body…

Initially, Su Yuqing thought it was idealistic, but then it tried to explain the theory scientifically.

There might be a way to preserve only the human brain and simulate neurons sending signals to the brain, making the brain immersed in a virtual world. Because of the neuronal signals, all sensations would exist: pain, touch, smell…

Just like the real thing.

The next idea in the book was even more insane. The author even believed that everyone's mind might just be a set of programs in a computer; in other words, we might not even have a physical body…

"Perhaps we are just 'God's' white mice," the book concluded.

Su Yuqing tilted her head in thought. This thin book had given her a much larger scope of imagination. Perhaps humans are really just a code existing in a computer program?

"Whew… philosophy, philosophy…" Su Yuqing sighed. After reading this book, she felt a chilling sensation. She still hoped she was a real person…

But she also hoped she was just a program. Because then, perhaps she could change her gender through her consciousness?

Su Yuqing put the book back on the shelf. She scanned the titles on the philosophy shelves, finding some with philosophical titles, and others that looked like science books but were placed in the philosophy section…

"What's outside the universe? Is the color you see the actual color? What are the limits of human imagination? If every organ in the body has its own consciousness…"

These books looked interesting, but Su Yuqing couldn't continue reading. It was getting late; the clock on the pillar pointed to six; it was already past six in the evening.

If she had the money, Su Yuqing really wanted to buy these books home to read slowly…

"Forget it… let's go home." Su Yuqing stretched languidly.  Her legs were numb from sitting cross-legged for a long time. She almost fell when she stood up.

Su Yuqing was easy to please. She wasn't picky about food, and didn't eat much.  Even if she skipped lunch, she wasn't particularly hungry. A dried vegetable pancake from a street vendor filled her stomach.

She had walked a lot that day and was sweaty, so a shower was necessary.

The weather was warm. For Su Yuqing, who had a cleanliness fetish, she would probably shower once a day even if she didn't sweat, unless it was raining…

The mirror reflected Su Yuqing's rosy complexion; she looked like a delicate porcelain doll. Her fingertips lightly brushed the two pink cherries on her chest, sending a jolt through her body.

Su Yuqing's body was becoming increasingly sensitive. Even a slight touch on her breasts would make her blush and her heart race.

She remembered the feeling of Mo Kong holding her breasts earlier. Though not large, they were slightly prominent, and the feeling of being squeezed…

Su Yuqing felt a flame rising from her lower abdomen, which she couldn't suppress.

She carefully cleaned the delicate part of her lovely caterpillar. Her body was already sensitive, and the water washing over her most sensitive area made her almost moan, enduring the constant tingling sensation. Her legs were weak and could barely support her…

Every shower was a mixture of pain and pleasure…

Su Yuqing rubbed the semi-soft caterpillar, wanting to move it up and down as she had seen in novels and comics, but she blushed and restrained herself.

Even to herself… she was still shy…

And Su Yuqing knew that the medicine harmed her kidneys. She should restrain herself as much as possible.

It was fortunate that Su Yuqing had never tried it, and didn't know what it would feel like. Otherwise, the urge and desire would be even harder to resist…

"Whew…" The wind outside gently blew into the room, cooling Su Yuqing's hot heart, and the caterpillar slowly returned to its "youthful" state.

This made Su Yuqing breathe a sigh of relief.  To be honest, that engorged feeling wasn't comfortable at all.
