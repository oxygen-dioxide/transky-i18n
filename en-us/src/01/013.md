# 13 · The Misty Rain

A moderate rain fell, a gentle, persistent drizzle.

The noodle shop's transparent glass door was drenched.  Rainwater streamed down, some in straight lines, others in crooked rivulets, pooling on the ground with the drops that had arrived before them, forming small, shallow puddles.

On rainy days, business at the noodle shop always suffered, and today was no exception.  Only five customers had come in all morning.

Uncle Li and Aunt Zhang sat leisurely chatting, working, occasionally glancing at Su Yuqing, still asleep.

“BOOM!” A dazzling flash of lightning ripped across the gloomy, dark sky, followed by a deafening clap of thunder that seemed to make the heavens tremble.

“PITTER-PATTER!” The rain, already moderate, intensified after the thunder, escalating from a drizzle to a downpour.

The rain came down in torrents, the drops drumming against the awning like frying beans.

The thunder shattered the darkness of Su Yuqing's dream, finally jolting her awake. She slowly opened her eyes.

Long lashes fluttered, a few glistening teardrops clinging to them—liquid secreted to protect her newly opened eyes.

"Awake?" Uncle Li asked with a smile. "Hungry? Want something to eat?"

Su Yuqing shyly rubbed her stomach and nodded slightly.  "Um... I'm sorry... I fell asleep this morning..."

"It's alright, we're pretty empty today anyway," Aunt Zhang said with a smile. "By the way, Xiaoqing, your Uncle Li and I have discussed it. We're going to change your work hours. You can come to the shop at 9 am, and we'll give you Mondays off.  That way you can sleep in. Young people shouldn't always be stuck in the shop. You can go out and do things on your day off."

"Huh?" Su Yuqing's face lit up, her voice laced with disbelief. "Really?"

"Of course, it's true."

"Great! Thank you, Boss and Boss Lady!"

For Su Yuqing, this was indeed good news. At least she could sleep in every day, avoiding the late nights and early mornings.  The weekly day off would also allow her to relax, even if it meant simply sleeping all day.

"Even if life is difficult, as long as you keep trying, things will get better…" Su Yuqing thought to herself.

However, some things should not be prematurely concluded.  After all, this wasn't a world of karmic retribution, like a religious text.

After sleeping, Su Yuqing felt much better.  The tightness in her chest had eased, and though her head was still a little fuzzy, she was much clearer.

She took a deep breath of the air, heavy with the rain, and for the first time felt the happiness of being able to breathe so freely.

"Hey, it's empty today," a young man's voice came from the doorway. Su Yuqing looked up instinctively. It was the customer from yesterday. His unkempt appearance made him somewhat memorable, preventing her from forgetting him entirely after a day.

"Boss, a large bowl of braised pork noodles, extra noodles, extra fried shallots, and an extra poached egg." The disheveled young man closed his umbrella, gave it a gentle shake, and entered the noodle shop.

His voice was somewhat hoarse, but not particularly deep; slightly husky, but not overly so; distinctive, yet not exceptionally unique.

Just another ordinary person among the masses.

Vaguely, Su Yuqing felt his voice was similar to the person who had woken her on the train, but she couldn't be sure.  While such a voice wasn't uncommon, it wasn't exactly rare either.

Perhaps she was overthinking.  How many coincidences are there in the world?

"Coming right up, please wait a moment." Boss Li quickly stood up, grabbed some noodles, and went into the kitchen.

The unkempt man hummed a slightly off-key tune, seemingly unfazed by the rain; in fact, he seemed quite cheerful.

The braised pork noodles arrived quickly. Boss Li then cooked Su Yuqing a bowl of zhajiangmian (noodles with fermented soybean paste), placing it in front of her.

Su Yuqing ate slowly, savoring each mouthful of noodles. It was a habit she had developed since childhood, perhaps a family rule—to chew slowly and thoroughly.

What surprised Su Yuqing was that the seemingly rough and unkempt man, with his stubble, ate his noodles with the same gentle manner. Like her, he ate slowly, bite by bite, unlike most men who slurp their noodles loudly.

"Boss, these noodles are really good. You must have some special sauce in them," the young man asked.

"Hehe! Of course! It's a special sauce with peanuts, sesame seeds, and the local specialty, lava chili.  The chili seeds are very spicy, but if you remove them, it tastes like a sweet pepper, at most a little bit spicy.  And it's incredibly fragrant."

"Oh~ No wonder. I thought I had no chili, but it had a little bit of a spicy kick." The young man nodded slightly, took a few sips of the soup, smacked his lips, and praised again, "This soup is even better…"

"Hehe, young man, you're different from other young people. Others find it delicious, and they eat quickly.  You, on the other hand, eat slower and slower, huh?"  Pleased by the compliment, Boss Li couldn't help but chat a little more.

"Delicious food should be savored slowly. To devour something exquisite like that is a waste."

"Haha, young man, you're quite articulate. Are you an intellectual?"

"Hmm, I've read a few books."

"Are you in college now?"

"No, I started working after high school," the young man sighed, but didn't seem particularly worried, instead smiling slightly.  "Jobs are hard to find."

"Yes, but you don't seem too concerned?"

"Haha, what's there to worry about?  Everything will work out.  This busy, drifting life, like a duckweed on the water, is sometimes quite interesting!"

"Ha, young man, you're no ordinary person. Your perspective is higher than mine."

"There are no ordinary people in the world. Everyone is extraordinary.  Even ordinary people have different kinds of commonness!" The young man took a bite of braised pork, chewing slowly, mumbling, "…."

Su Yuqing listened from the side, feeling that this twenty-something-year-old knew a lot. His words always seemed to contain a hint of philosophy.

However, to have such rich life experience, he must have endured many hardships and setbacks, right?

"What kind of work do you do, young man? I see you work quite late. Are you a white-collar worker?"

Small cities also have office buildings and white-collar workers, although they are more ordinary and less well-paid than those in larger cities, it remains a job many aspire to.

But becoming a white-collar worker in this era wasn't easy.  In fact, many in this era equated white-collar workers with wealth.

"Certainly not." The young man shook his head with a smile. "I just do odd jobs occasionally and write stories."

"Write stories?" Boss Li's eyes widened, his speech becoming more polite. "Are you a writer?"

"Haha…" The young man chuckled and shook his head. "Of course not. I'm just someone who writes stories." He finished the last bit of noodles, took another sip of soup, and asked, "Boss, how much?"

"Five yuan."

"Here you go." The young man placed a five-yuan bill on the table and turned to leave with a carefree air.

"Whoosh!" He opened his white umbrella and stepped into the heavy rain, the raindrops drumming against his umbrella.

"Come again next time!" Boss Li shouted from the doorway.

"Sure." The young man waved back lightly, his figure gradually disappearing into the misty downpour.

Su Yuqing withdrew her gaze from the young man and continued eating her zhajiangmian, carefully savoring the flavors the boss had described: the peanuts and sesame seeds, the slight spiciness of the chili…

All mixed together.

Although Su Yuqing always chewed slowly, this was the first time she had truly focused on the taste of the food, imagining the cooking process—the heat, the amount of salt and MSG, the number of times the ingredients were tossed…

The rain continued to fall. The sky remained overcast all day, the streetlights casting a dim glow, indicating extremely poor visibility.

Rain always evokes a sense of sadness, involuntarily bringing back painful memories.  It's because the form of rain resembles tears, and the gloomy sky mirrors a sorrowful heart.  This resonance makes people recall past sorrows.


"I wonder if my parents are looking for me. Will they file a police report?"

"Or will they be happy, and have another child to replace me?"

"If they can't find me, will they be anxious? Worried? Scared?"

"Where would they look for me…"

"If they really can't find me, will they give up?"

"I wonder how they're doing…"

"I wonder if they're staying up at night because of me…"

"If they give up on me, will they throw away everything in my room?"

"If they really have another child, I hope that child is a real… boy…"

Su Yuqing looked up at the gloomy sky and thought silently.
