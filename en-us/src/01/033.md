# 33 · A Promise with Yuecheng

Su Yuqing didn't wake up all night. It wasn't that she didn't want to; she simply couldn't.  She felt trapped in a dream, a pitch-black dream where her body swung wildly between freezing and burning, like being tossed from a volcano into an ice floe, then back again, repeatedly…

Her clothes were soaked through with sweat.

This sensation, however long it lasted, eventually subsided. Su Yuqing’s tormented consciousness finally slipped into true sleep. For the first time, she felt the blissful comfort of a sound sleep.

At seven the next morning, Su Yuqing slowly woke.

The rising sun warmed her, giving her a feeling of rebirth, filling her with vitality and energy.

“Looks like…the fever’s broken?” Su Yuqing touched her forehead. It was no longer hot. Compared to yesterday’s weakness, today she felt remarkably energetic, bursting with unspent strength.

Perhaps the stark contrast between yesterday and today created this illusion. In reality, she had simply returned to her normal state.

Her sweat-dampened clothes were mostly dry, though the areas around her back remained wet, along with the bedding.

Su Yuqing frowned.  She wanted to change the sweat-soaked bedding but had no replacements, so she gave up.

For Su Yuqing, who had a mild case of潔癖, this was quite uncomfortable.

But at the very least, she could air it out in the sun.

Looking up at the cloudless sky, she decided it wasn't going to rain, so she confidently gathered the bedding.

“Hmm…what’s that smell…?” Su Yuqing struggled to carry the heavy comforter, sniffing, and murmuring to herself, “Hmm…milk?”

Her bedding carried a milky scent, like that of a young child…

Although her former classmate had mentioned a milky scent about her, she’d never been able to smell it herself, not on her bedding or clothes.

But today, the scent was unusually strong, perhaps intensified by the sweat…

Thankfully, it was the scent of milk. If it had been body odor, even without a blanket, Su Yuqing probably would have washed the comforter.

Su Yuqing had planned on showering, but considering her limited supply of clean clothes and upcoming work, she decided against it.

Her improved spirits lifted her mood. Everything seemed pleasant today, even a trash can blown over by last night’s wind looked stylish…

She felt inexplicably cheerful, finding herself increasingly strange…

Humming a self-composed tune, she skipped down the alley of the farmhouse.  A black cat with brown ears perched on a low wall. Seeing Su Yuqing, it lazily lifted its head and meowed softly.

“Meow~”

“Morning, Cookie,” Su Yuqing greeted the cat with a smile.

Cookie flicked its ears, seemingly responding to the name. It seemed to know Su Yuqing was calling it.

Su Yuqing passed Cookie, who remained on the wall, looking relaxed and leisurely.

The bright, warm sunlight bathed Cookie, causing it to comfortably close its eyes, seemingly about to fall asleep.

“Morning, Xiaoqing, you look lively today,” Zhang Auntie smiled, her eyes crinkling.

“Yeah…because I went to bed early last night,” Su Yuqing shyly scratched her cheek.  Zhang Auntie's greetings always warmed her heart; this feeling of being cared for was truly wonderful.

After yesterday’s difficult work while sick, Su Yuqing found her job surprisingly easy. She rarely fumbled as she did at first; she could handle many tasks without the boss or boss's wife instructing her.

If, at first, Li Boss and Zhang Auntie showed Su Yuqing more care and affection, now, because of her work ethic, they had developed fondness for her.

Su Yuqing subtly noticed the change in the boss and boss's wife's attitudes and felt happy; she could finally perform her job well instead of feeling like someone being given charity…

At around 2 pm, Su Yuqing finally got a break. The shop had no customers; it was past lunchtime and before dinner.  Even if customers did come, it would be a few scattered ones, unlike the midday rush.

“Xiaoqing, tired?” Li Boss smiled kindly, placing a bowl of covered rice over Su Yuqing’s table, “Always noodles, getting tired of it? Have some rice today.”

“Mmm…it's okay…uh, thank you, Uncle Li…”

“Zhang Auntie and I treat you like our own child, no need to be so polite,” Li Boss laughed, patting Su Yuqing’s shoulder, and went into the kitchen to get a bowl of rice for himself.

Initially, Su Yuqing wondered why the noodle shop had rice, but she understood.  Even delicious noodles become tiring if eaten daily.  Sometimes, one needs a change.

Su Yuqing hadn't had rice for days; it tasted exceptionally good today, even plain rice, she felt she could eat a lot.

That was only her thought; her stomach couldn't hold much.

Su Yuqing handled most of the day's customer service; the boss and boss's wife worked in the kitchen.  Perhaps because of the exhausting day, Li Boss rewarded Su Yuqing with her covered rice, with large portions of pork chops, kidneys, large intestine, chicken, and beef…  While each portion was small, combined, it was substantial, perhaps even more than the rice itself.

“Xiaoqing, eat more, replenish yourself, there's more,” Zhang Auntie added.

“Mmm…” Su Yuqing softly nodded, savoring each bite.

“Xiaoqing…” Zhang Auntie swallowed her food, then spoke.

“Mmm…what is it?”

“You eat so delicately; you really act like a girl,” Zhang Auntie joked. She secretly suspected Su Yuqing's gender, even wondering if Su Yuqing was a girl pretending to be a boy to avoid bullying.

“…” Su Yuqing remained silent, half happy, half apprehensive.  Happy that someone thought she was like a real girl, but apprehensive about Zhang Auntie’s intent.

Seeing Su Yuqing's silence, Zhang Auntie didn't press further; everyone has things they don't want to talk about.

After lunch, a short rest, then more work until 9 pm.

As usual, Su Yuqing bid farewell to the boss and boss’s wife.

“Uncle Li, Auntie Zhang, I'm going home.”

“Mm, take care.” Li Boss replied.

“Xiaoqing, be careful on your way home, don't walk down dark alleys, watch out for bad guys,” Zhang Auntie said with concern, hinting at something.

Su Yuqing noticed Zhang Auntie's suspicion about her gender.

While she wanted to admit she was a girl, one lie leads to many more, merely for comfort, it wasn't necessary.

So, Su Yuqing replied, “I won't…I'm a boy…”

“Anyway, be careful.”

“Mm.”

Su Yuqing didn’t hurry home but went to a nearby convenience store, not to buy anything, but to use a payphone.

In 2004, cell phones weren't widespread, especially among poor families, so payphones were everywhere.  They were "public" but charged; about fifty cents a minute.

Even a brief call cost fifty cents…

Su Yuqing wrote Yuecheng’s number in a small notebook. At the store, she dialed.

“Hello?” A clear voice answered, sounding like a sunny boy, but somewhat weak, lacking energy.

“Hello, is this Yuecheng?”

“Yuecheng…?” The person paused, then reacted, excitedly asking, “Ah!  Qingquan?”

“Yes, it's me…” Even through the phone, Su Yuqing couldn't resist the enthusiasm and excitement, replying softly.

“Your voice is so nice, clear and soft, is it a falsetto?”

“Falsetto…?”

“Eh?  It’s your real voice?!  It really is your real voice?!” The other person became even more excited, as if wanting to meet Su Yuqing immediately…

“That, on Monday at the city center square…is that okay?”

“No problem! What time?”

“Hmm…what do you think…?”

“Too early in the morning, I won't be able to get up…how about 9 o’clock there…?”

“Okay…”

“Right, we need a landmark, you don’t have a phone, I won’t recognize you.”

“Hmm…I’ll wear a white baseball cap…”

“Okay…wait for me under the pine tree outside the jewelry store in the city center square, that should work.”

“Okay…”

…
