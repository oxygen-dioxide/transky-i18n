# 29 · The Visiting Cat

The gradually warming weather was a good thing for Su Yuqing. At the very least, she didn't have to boil several pots of hot water to shower.  The warm weather meant the water didn't need to be as hot as it had been in the colder days; a moderate temperature was sufficient.  For someone with a hardier constitution, even a cold shower would be fine.

The bathroom itself was tiny; aside from the toilet, there was very little standing room.

Even for Su Yuqing's petite frame, showering in there felt cramped.

"If only I had money…" Su Yuqing murmured, sitting on a small stool in the bathroom's limited space. "I want to take a bath… I want to take a nice, long shower…"

With money, she could go to a bathhouse.  With even more money, a sauna wouldn't be out of the question.

But what Su Yuqing lacked most was money.

When she had money to spare, she didn't feel particularly reliant on it. Now that money was tight, she felt like she needed to stretch every dollar.

Su Yuqing gently scrubbed her thighs. Perhaps it was the estrogen, perhaps the medication, but she felt her thigh skin had become smoother. Even up close, it was hard to see any pores.

Touching her thighs, Su Yuqing felt a strange sensation…

If she pressed too hard, it would hurt slightly, but a gentler touch produced a tingling softness, like someone was tickling her.

Logically, she shouldn't feel an itch touching herself, unless her skin was overly sensitive…

"Whoosh—" Su Yuqing turned off the showerhead and used a dry towel to wipe her hair. Short hair had its advantages; she didn't need a hairdryer, it dried instantly…

Though only a week or so had passed, Su Yuqing's hair had grown slightly. It was still a buzz cut, but it looked much better than the "ugly" appearance right after she'd shaved her head.

Moreover, Su Yuqing could clearly feel that the new millimeters of hair were significantly finer than her previous hair.  It wasn't very noticeable yet because it was so short, but maybe someday Su Yuqing would have soft, long hair?

This was probably also the effect of the medication.

People like Su Yuqing certainly harbored a wish: to have soft, flowing hair like a real girl's, hair that grew naturally. Wigs, after all, weren't truly their own.

"Grow faster, grow faster…" Su Yuqing muttered to her reflection in the mirror, like a witch casting a spell, as if saying it would make her hair grow quickly.

Hair grows slowly. Even for fast-growing hair, reaching shoulder length would take at least a month or two; slower growth could take three months or even half a year.  No wonder Su Yuqing had been so angry when her shoulder-length hair was shaved into a buzz cut.

It's like someone meticulously crafting something for half a year, only to have it ripped apart and forced to start over. That feeling could drive anyone mad.

Her acne was almost completely gone, only one or two barely visible spots remained, hardly noticeable even without a hat.

"Phew… almost gone." Su Yuqing touched her smooth forehead. Only the acne spots had been raised; in a couple of days, the pimples would be gone, filling her with a sense of relief.

Most people would feel annoyed with acne, wouldn't they? Especially someone as "beauty-conscious" as Su Yuqing.

After showering, she immediately washed her clothes. Su Yuqing didn't like putting things off. She preferred finishing tasks the same day; otherwise, she couldn't even sleep peacefully.

"Ten o'clock…" Su Yuqing looked at the clock, then at her neatly made bed, but she felt unusually energetic and didn't seem sleepy at all.

Lying in bed wouldn't help her sleep; she'd only become more alert.  She'd better find something to do and sleep when she felt tired.

Thinking this, Su Yuqing sat at her desk and started writing in her diary.  The entry was about the forum friend who lived in the same city.

The diary entry was quickly finished, but Su Yuqing still wasn't sleepy.  So she started drawing in a sketchbook.

Su Yuqing had learned to draw as a child, but she stopped due to busy studies. She still enjoyed drawing, though; when bored, she'd doodle for a while.  It wasn't just drawing; it was a way to sort out her feelings.

Don't think that children from wealthy families always have comfortable lives. Su Yuqing's childhood wasn't particularly happy. From kindergarten, she faced numerous extracurricular activities, with only half a day off on weekends.

Elementary school was even more demanding; throughout the year, even during summer and winter breaks, she hardly had any time off.

Calligraphy, painting, piano, guzheng, math Olympiad, dance, taekwondo…

These activities filled Su Yuqing's free time, leaving her no breathing room.

Wealthy people didn't lack money, so they tried their best to cultivate their children into well-rounded individuals. But where are there perfect people in the world?  One or two special skills are already good enough, yet most Chinese parents want their children to excel in everything.  Isn't that a joke?

How many of these so-called well-rounded children have actually succeeded?  As adults, don't they still blend into the crowd?

Being good at everything means being good at nothing, because nothing is mastered.

Knowing a little bit of everything is worse than knowing nothing at all.

It wasn't until junior high that the extracurricular activities decreased, because junior high school courses were much more demanding, with more homework.

Even though the extracurricular classes were reduced, tutoring remained abundant. Even knowing her parents were trying to help her learn more and better, Su Yuqing still inevitably felt rebellious.

Su Yuqing's drawing skills weren't very high; she could only draw some simple sketches. She knew a bit of sketching, but could only draw objects, especially those with sharp edges.  If she tried drawing people, she couldn't get them right.

Her doodling leaned more towards simple sketches; a few strokes could create something.  In her sketchbook, she drew a small black cat.  Though simple, it vaguely resembled Cookie.

"Meow—" As Su Yuqing carefully colored the black cat, a real cat's meow came from outside the window.

Cookie stood pressed against the windowsill.  Its almost entirely black fur was somewhat hazy in the night, only its pair of bright blue eyes stood out.

Though Cookie was a stray cat, its fur was always neatly groomed, unlike a wild cat.

"Meow?" Su Yuqing responded in "cat language."

Of course, Cookie wouldn't understand.

Cookie lazily lifted its front paw to lick itself. Even on the narrow windowsill, it showed no nervousness.

Then it tapped the windowpane with its raised paw, like a visitor paying a call.

This cat was so human-like. Su Yuqing found herself liking it more and more, although it seemed to prefer roaming outside rather than staying indoors.

However, it didn't seem to have forgotten Su Yuqing; it would occasionally drop by…

"Swish—" Su Yuqing opened the window.  The cool breeze rushed into the room, causing Su Yuqing, who had just showered, to shiver slightly. She was only wearing a large shirt and boxer shorts, offering little warmth.

Cookie didn't rush in.  Instead, it picked up something from a visual blind spot in the left corner of the windowsill, then slowly walked in and stood on Su Yuqing's desk.

"Whoa!" Su Yuqing gasped, taking two steps backward in surprise.

Cookie was holding a gray mouse in its mouth.  The mouse wasn't big, probably just weaned, with gray fur that wasn't dirty but rather smooth, like silk.

It was an unusual mouse.

Su Yuqing wasn't afraid of mice, only of dirt. Mice lived in sewers and drains, carrying bacteria…

For her, mice were as disgusting as cockroaches.  However, killing a cockroach didn't cause much psychological burden, but killing a mouse felt bloody.

And that's what Cookie intended to do.

The mouse wasn't dead but extremely weak, having been played with by Cookie for a long time, its strength exhausted.  Except for its slightly twitching tail, it looked dead.

If nothing unexpected happened, it would surely become Cookie's dinner.

Unexpectedly, Cookie placed the weaned mouse on Su Yuqing's desk. Although the mouse was recently weaned and didn't look very dirty, Su Yuqing still didn't want to get close. Standing two steps away, she asked in confusion, "Um…? What's this?"

Cookie didn't understand Su Yuqing's words, but it understood her expression.  It pointed at the mouse with its paw, then at Su Yuqing, as if trying to convey something.

"Huh?" Cookie's body language was too simple for Su Yuqing to understand its intentions.

Seeing Su Yuqing still didn't understand, Cookie picked up the mouse again, carried it a few steps closer to Su Yuqing, and pressed one paw on it to prevent it from escaping.

Su Yuqing felt she understood Cookie's meaning.

Perhaps… it was like a guest bringing a gift?
